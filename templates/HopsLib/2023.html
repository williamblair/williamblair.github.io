<h3>01/02/2023</h3>
<p>Testing different 3d model formats for the AssimpMesh class. I tried 3DS
but it seems this format doesn't store skeletal information, or at least
assimp doesn't load it. Also it seems Blender doesn't support 3DS by default.
So far, glTF and DAE have been tested working on PC, and glTF on PS3. IQM
format loads but doesn't have animations/skeleton.</p>
