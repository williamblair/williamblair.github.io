<p>The wiibrew website has basically all of the information necessary
to get started:
<a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Main_Page">https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>.
The SDK is called devkitPro, and it also provides libraries for the GBA, Nintendo DS,
GameCube, and a couple of other platforms.
</p>

<p>A binary installation of the sdk is done via a custom pacman package
manager:
<a href="https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started">https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started</a>.
After the custom pacman is installed, simply run:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dkp-pacman -S wii-dev
</code></pre>

<p>To test the code on PC, the dolphin emulator seems to be the most popular:
<a href="https://www.linux.org/threads/dolphin-%E2%80%93-wii-emulator-even-the-newest-versions-of-ubuntu.37798/">
https://www.linux.org/threads/dolphin-%E2%80%93-wii-emulator-even-the-newest-versions-of-ubuntu.37798/
</a>
</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:dolphin-emu/ppa
sudo apt install dolphin-emu
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at the included examples in /opt/devkitpro/examples/wii/graphics/gx/neheGX
(which are Wii versions of the famous now legacy NeHe OpenGL tutorials),
the programs are very OpenGL 1-2 like, with the fixed-function pipeline (no shaders).
Some example code for drawing a triangle:</p>
<pre><code>GX_Begin(GX_TRIANGLES, GX_VTXFMT0, 3);
    GX_Position3f32( 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);		// Top
    GX_Color3f32(1.0f,0.0f,0.0f);			// Set The Color To Red
    GX_Position3f32(-1.0f,-1.0f, 0.0f);	// Bottom Left
    GX_Color3f32(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f);			// Set The Color To Green
    GX_Position3f32( 1.0f,-1.0f, 0.0f);	// Bottom Right
    GX_Color3f32(0.0f,0.0f,1.0f);			// Set The Color To Blue
GX_End();
</code></pre>

<p>I've been working on getting an IQM animated model working.This is since I've
been working with raylib recently, which uses the IQM format. I ported the
<a href="https://github.com/lsalzman/iqm">iqm github example</a> which
shows animates a single simple IQM model.</p>

<p>I was having trouble using the devktPro libogc math library to properly
animate the IQM. Using the github IQM example geom math library, the animation
worked no problem. I ended up starting my own math library, initially in C++,
to debug the issue. Once that worked, I added back in the optimized libogc
math functions within the math library.</p>
<p>The two important notes are
that the libogc matrices are row-major (as opposed to column major in OpenGL),
and most of the math functions work with 3x4 matrices instead of 4x4. Luckily,
you can simply cast the 4x4 matrices as 3x4 and they still work properly.
The math library is <a href="https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/gamemath/src/master/">here</a>,
and I figure I can add implementations for other consoles since I already have alot of
math code (for example for the ps2, ps3).</p>

<p>Said math library is added as a submodule to the main code, which can be found
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/wiiprogtest/src/master/">here</a></p>

<p>And, surprisingly, it works on hardware the first try!</p>

<p>Added third person camera controller and custom IQM model, as well as a textured tile floor.
TODO is to add more animations to the character (e.g. an idle anim).</p>

<p>Iqm format models can be exported from blender via the plugin
from the github IQM link (see my
<a href="../raylib/log.html">raylib experiments page</a>).
For getting an animated model, I found
<a href="https://youtu.be/su8KURZ6vRc">this video</a> and
<a href="https://youtu.be/wYqJ7AyEuhc">this video</a> introducing
me to mixamo, owned by adobe. It contains a good amount of 3d models
and a ton of animations that you can apply to any character model! You just upload
the model and select the location of each of the joints. I singled out a character
from <a href="https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/17-walking-people-3d-model/165559">this model pack</a>,
uploaded it to mixamo to give it a walking animation (the source file was a .max, so I
opened it in 3ds max and exported it but had trouble exporting the animations properly),
then loaded it and exported it from blender as an IQM model.</p>
