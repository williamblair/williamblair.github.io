<h1>GameLib</h1>

<p>
Starting to combine my code for different platforms into a single library.
For now simply called <i>GameLib</i>. TBD a cooler, better sounding name :).
Originally this repo had PS2 and PSX code, now I'm redoing it as I have more
experience and worked with other platforms. Plus, multiplatform support including
PSX is hard because of the PSX needing to do everything in fixed-point.
</p>

<p>
The code is here:
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/workspace/projects/GAM">https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/workspace/projects/GAM</a>,
where the GameLib repo contains the library code, and iqmanimpc for now is the test applicaton.
Also uses my GameMath library as a submodule for GameLib:

<p>Base PC and Wii implementations working together. Includes a third-person controlled
animated IQM model and tiled floor:</p>

<p>The PC implementation uses Visual Studio 2019 for Windows.
The libraries used are SDL2 and GLEW, so it *should* work
on Linux as well. Still need to make a Makefile for linux. For
windows, compile.bat is used with the VS developer command prompt
to call cl.exe with the required args. A preprocessor define
PC_BUILD is used by GameMath and some initialization/file loading.</p>

<p>The wii implementation uses Makefile.wii with devkitpro. The main
difference between the Wii and PC implemenations currently is texture
loading on the wii uses textures baked into the code, so the loading
functions are different. TODO is figure out how to load textures for
wii from a file. The preprocessor define WII_BUILD is used in this
case. The differences between main.cpp for the PC and Wii are:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef PC_BUILD
using namespace GameLib::PC;
#undef main
#endif

#ifdef WII_BUILD
// IQM texture
#include "Gina.h"
#include "Gina_tpl.h"
// Ground texture
#include "grass.h"
#include "grass_tpl.h"
using namespace GameLib::Wii;
#endif

...

#ifdef PC_BUILD
    if (!gRender.Init(800, 600, "Hello World")) { return 1; }
    if (!gInput.Init()) { return 1; }
    if (!gGrassTex.LoadFromTGA("assets/grass.tga")) { return 1; }
    if (!gIqm.Init("assets/gina.iqm")) { return 1; }
    if (!gIqmTex.LoadFromTGA("assets/gina.tga")) { return 1; }
#endif
#ifdef WII_BUILD
    if (!gRender.Init(640, 480, "Hello World")) { return 1; }
    if (!gInput.Init()) { return 1; }
    if (!gGrassTex.Init(grass_tpl, grass_tpl_size, grass)) { return 1; }
    if (!gIqm.Init("sd:/gina.iqm")) { return 1; }
    if (!gIqmTex.Init(Gina_tpl, Gina_tpl_size, gina)) { return 1; }
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>TODO is to retest on Wii hardware to make sure it still works. Up next is the
PS3 base implementation. Hopefully after that PS2 support as well (maybe...)</p>

<h3>04/24/2022</h3>

<p>Started PS3 implementation. Confirmed a simple triangle drawing works.
Basically all there, except there's still a camera
issue between tiny3d using +z=forwards 0..65535 and GameMath using +z=backwards.
I think the main issue currently is the tiny3d vertex shader:</p>
<pre><code>v = mul(inputvertex.vertex, WorldMatrix);
outputvertex.vertex    = mul(v,ProjMatrix);
outputvertex.vertex.z *= outputvertex.vertex.w;
</code></pre>

<p>This last line (z*w) I believe is causing the GameMath matrix implementations
to be incompatible. I've been trying to figure out if I can remove that line and
recompile ther vertex shader for tiny3d. It seems to be baked into the code via
the vpcomp utility, which is no longer used by PSL1GHT and has been replaced by cgcomp.
Cgcomp seems to output a different format than vpcomp. I was able to compile vpcomp from
an older commit of PSL1GHT, but it gives errors when trying to compile the vertex shader.
The first error was "pow" being an unsupported function</p>

<img src="images/vpcomp_error1_04_24_2022.png" width="600px"/>

<p>After commenting out the line that uses pow, a error related to a register
is given:</p>

<img src="images/vpcomp_error2_04_24_2022.png" width="600px"/>

<p>I'm guessing maybe the version of nvidia-cg-toolkit (libCg)
is newer now compared to ~2011 and is causing the issue? However
older versions from the nvidia website are unavailable (only 3.31
is available). The only other thing I can try maybe is modifying
the tiny3d source code to account for the z*w vertex shader line
when sending vertices/matrices to the shader. Otherwise I might
try just using PSL1GHT again without tiny3d and make the code more similar to how
tiny3d works (allocating a single block of RSX memory for vertices)</p>

<h3>04/28/2022</h3>

<p>Switched from tiny3d to plain PSL1GHT ps3 impl. Had two issues:
one, there seems to be a bug somewhere in the ps3 implementation of GameMath, as switching
from the ps3 impl to the plain c++ impl fixed incorrect rendering initially. I haven't
looked into the issue yet. I thought I had ran into this and already fixed it earlier,
but maybe not.</p>

<p>The second was that some vertices would freak out and render incorrectly on my actual
PS3 hardware but not on rpcs3. I've seen this happen before on my previous PS3/PSL1GHT programs
so I wasn't super surprised that it happened. After playing around with different options related
to vertex clipping in the renderer code, the following seem to have fixed the issue/render correctly
without freakouts:</p>
<pre><code>// don't call this function:
//rsxSetZMinMaxControl(context, 0, 1, 1);

// do call this function:
for (i=0; i&lt;8; i++) {
    rsxSetViewportClip(context, i, display_width, display_height);
}

// don't call this function:
//rsxSetUserClipPlaneControl(context,GCM_USER_CLIP_PLANE_DISABLE,GCM_USER_CLIP_PLANE_DISABLE,...)
</code></pre>
<p>Which were functions I saw used in different examples code. Also, as a side note, I was able
to use OpenGL-style glsl shaders following this post by user Crystal:
<a href="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/how-to-use-glsl-shaders-inside-psl1ght-rsx-projects.34239/">link</a>.
The glsl and regular PSL1GHT equivalent versions of the shader I'm using so far are:
</p>

<pre><code>//glsl vertex/fragment shader
#version 130
in vec3 aPos;
in vec3 aColor;
out vec4 fragColor;
uniform mat4 uMvpMatrix;
void main(void)
{
    gl_Position = uMvpMatrix * vec4(aPos, 1.0);
    fragColor = vec4(aColor, 1.0);
}
---
#version 130
out vec4 FragColor;
in vec4 fragColor;
void main(void)
{
    FragColor = fragColor;
}

// PSL1GHT version (hlsl/directX? not sure)
void main
(
    float3 aPos : POSITION,
    float3 aColor : COLOR,
    uniform float4x4 uMvpMatrix,
    out float4 ePosition : POSITION,
    out float3 oColor : COLOR
)
{
    float4 v;
    v = mul(float4(aPos, 1.0f), uMvpMatrix);
    ePosition = v;
    oColor = aColor;
}
---
void main
(
    float3 color : COLOR,
    out float4 oColor
)
{
    float4 testColor = float4(color, 1.0);
    oColor = testColor;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Currently the PSL1GHT version is used and is what I tested on my actual PS3. Below
shows before fixing the vertex freakout issue and after. Next TODO for PS3 is to add back in
textures and IQM model support.</p>
