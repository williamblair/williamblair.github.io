<h1>GameLib</h1>

<p>
Starting to combine my code for different platforms into a single library.
For now simply called <i>GameLib</i>. TBD a cooler, better sounding name :).
Originally this repo had PS2 and PSX code, now I'm redoing it as I have more
experience and worked with other platforms. Plus, multiplatform support including
PSX is hard because of the PSX needing to do everything in fixed-point.
</p>

<p>
The code is here:
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/workspace/projects/GAM">https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/workspace/projects/GAM</a>,
where the GameLib repo contains the library code, and iqmanimpc for now is the test applicaton.
Also uses my GameMath library as a submodule for GameLib:
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/gamemath/src/master/">https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/gamemath/src/master/</a>
</p>

<h3>04/23/2022</h3>
<p>Base PC and Wii implementations working together. Includes a third-person controlled
animated IQM model and tiled floor:</p>

<img src="images/iqmanim_04_23_2022.png" width="400px"/>

<p>The PC implementation uses Visual Studio 2019 for Windows.
The libraries used are SDL2 and GLEW, so it *should* work
on Linux as well. Still need to make a Makefile for linux. For
windows, compile.bat is used with the VS developer command prompt
to call cl.exe with the required args. A preprocessor define
PC_BUILD is used by GameMath and some initialization/file loading.</p>

<p>The wii implementation uses Makefile.wii with devkitpro. The main
difference between the Wii and PC implemenations currently is texture
loading on the wii uses textures baked into the code, so the loading
functions are different. TODO is figure out how to load textures for
wii from a file. The preprocessor define WII_BUILD is used in this
case. The differences between main.cpp for the PC and Wii are:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef PC_BUILD
using namespace GameLib::PC;
#undef main
#endif

#ifdef WII_BUILD
// IQM texture
#include "Gina.h"
#include "Gina_tpl.h"
// Ground texture
#include "grass.h"
#include "grass_tpl.h"
using namespace GameLib::Wii;
#endif

...

#ifdef PC_BUILD
    if (!gRender.Init(800, 600, "Hello World")) { return 1; }
    if (!gInput.Init()) { return 1; }
    if (!gGrassTex.LoadFromTGA("assets/grass.tga")) { return 1; }
    if (!gIqm.Init("assets/gina.iqm")) { return 1; }
    if (!gIqmTex.LoadFromTGA("assets/gina.tga")) { return 1; }
#endif
#ifdef WII_BUILD
    if (!gRender.Init(640, 480, "Hello World")) { return 1; }
    if (!gInput.Init()) { return 1; }
    if (!gGrassTex.Init(grass_tpl, grass_tpl_size, grass)) { return 1; }
    if (!gIqm.Init("sd:/gina.iqm")) { return 1; }
    if (!gIqmTex.Init(Gina_tpl, Gina_tpl_size, gina)) { return 1; }
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>TODO is to retest on Wii hardware to make sure it still works. Up next is the
PS3 base implementation. Hopefully after that PS2 support as well (maybe...)</p>

<h3>04/24/2022</h3>

<p>Started PS3 implementation. Confirmed a simple triangle drawing works.
Basically all there, except there's still a camera
issue between tiny3d using +z=forwards 0..65535 and GameMath using +z=backwards.
I think the main issue currently is the tiny3d vertex shader:</p>
<pre><code>v = mul(inputvertex.vertex, WorldMatrix);
outputvertex.vertex    = mul(v,ProjMatrix);
outputvertex.vertex.z *= outputvertex.vertex.w;
</code></pre>

<p>This last line (z*w) I believe is causing the GameMath matrix implementations
to be incompatible. I've been trying to figure out if I can remove that line and
recompile ther vertex shader for tiny3d. It seems to be baked into the code via
the vpcomp utility, which is no longer used by PSL1GHT and has been replaced by cgcomp.
Cgcomp seems to output a different format than vpcomp. I was able to compile vpcomp from
an older commit of PSL1GHT, but it gives errors when trying to compile the vertex shader.
The first error was "pow" being an unsupported function</p>

<img src="images/vpcomp_error1_04_24_2022.png" width="600px"/>

<p>After commenting out the line that uses pow, a error related to a register
is given:</p>

<img src="images/vpcomp_error2_04_24_2022.png" width="600px"/>

<p>I'm guessing maybe the version of nvidia-cg-toolkit (libCg)
is newer now compared to ~2011 and is causing the issue? However
older versions from the nvidia website are unavailable (only 3.31
is available). The only other thing I can try maybe is modifying
the tiny3d source code to account for the z*w vertex shader line
when sending vertices/matrices to the shader. Otherwise I might
try just using PSL1GHT again without tiny3d and make the code more similar to how
tiny3d works (allocating a single block of RSX memory for vertices)</p>

<h3>04/28/2022</h3>

<p>Switched from tiny3d to plain PSL1GHT ps3 impl. Had two issues:
one, there seems to be a bug somewhere in the ps3 implementation of GameMath, as switching
from the ps3 impl to the plain c++ impl fixed incorrect rendering initially. I haven't
looked into the issue yet. I thought I had ran into this and already fixed it earlier,
but maybe not.</p>

<p>The second was that some vertices would freak out and render incorrectly on my actual
PS3 hardware but not on rpcs3. I've seen this happen before on my previous PS3/PSL1GHT programs
so I wasn't super surprised that it happened. After playing around with different options related
to vertex clipping in the renderer code, the following seem to have fixed the issue/render correctly
without freakouts:</p>
<pre><code>// don't call this function:
//rsxSetZMinMaxControl(context, 0, 1, 1);

// do call this function:
for (i=0; i&lt;8; i++) {
    rsxSetViewportClip(context, i, display_width, display_height);
}

// don't call this function:
//rsxSetUserClipPlaneControl(context,GCM_USER_CLIP_PLANE_DISABLE,GCM_USER_CLIP_PLANE_DISABLE,...)
</code></pre>
<p>Which were functions I saw used in different examples code. Also, as a side note, I was able
to use OpenGL-style glsl shaders following this post by user Crystal:
<a href="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/how-to-use-glsl-shaders-inside-psl1ght-rsx-projects.34239/">link</a>.
The glsl and regular PSL1GHT equivalent versions of the shader I'm using so far are:
</p>

<pre><code>//glsl vertex/fragment shader
#version 130
in vec3 aPos;
in vec3 aColor;
out vec4 fragColor;
uniform mat4 uMvpMatrix;
void main(void)
{
    gl_Position = uMvpMatrix * vec4(aPos, 1.0);
    fragColor = vec4(aColor, 1.0);
}
---
#version 130
out vec4 FragColor;
in vec4 fragColor;
void main(void)
{
    FragColor = fragColor;
}

// PSL1GHT version (hlsl/directX? not sure)
void main
(
    float3 aPos : POSITION,
    float3 aColor : COLOR,
    uniform float4x4 uMvpMatrix,
    out float4 ePosition : POSITION,
    out float3 oColor : COLOR
)
{
    float4 v;
    v = mul(float4(aPos, 1.0f), uMvpMatrix);
    ePosition = v;
    oColor = aColor;
}
---
void main
(
    float3 color : COLOR,
    out float4 oColor
)
{
    float4 testColor = float4(color, 1.0);
    oColor = testColor;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Currently the PSL1GHT version is used and is what I tested on my actual PS3. Below
shows before fixing the vertex freakout issue and after. Next TODO for PS3 is to add back in
textures and IQM model support.</p>

<h3>04/29/2022</h3>
<p>Got PS3 iqm anim working and re-verified Wii working on hardware. Also made some
changes on the Wii implementation to get the hello world simple triangle drawing
working. The issue for Wii was the Renderer::Clear() call was setting up to use
a texture, which the simple triangle drawing wasn't using.</p>
<p>For the rest of the ps3 impl for iqm animation, I found again there's an issue
with the PS3 GameMath impl. When using the PS3 impl, the IQM model wasn't shown
onscreen, but the tile floor rendered fine/as expected. That makes me think there's
something wrong with the Quaternion ps3 impl, as the tile floor doesn't use them.
For now though, switching it to use the plain cpp implementation of GameMath works
fine.</p>
<p>The shader I added for textured rendering on ps3 looks like:</p>
<pre><code>void main
(
    float3 aPos : POSITION,
    float2 aTexCoord : TEXCOORD0,

    uniform float4x4 uMvpMatrix,

    out float4 ePosition : POSITION,
    out float2 oTexCoord : TEXCOORD0
)
{
    float4 v;

    v = mul(float4(aPos, 1.0f), uMvpMatrix);
    ePosition = v;

    oTexCoord = aTexCoord;
}
---
void main
(
    float2 texCoord : TEXCOORD0,

    uniform sampler2D uTexture,

    out float4 oColor
)
{
    float4 testColor = tex2D(uTexture, texCoord);
    oColor = testColor;
}</code></pre>

<p>Yesterday I got the pspdev environment set up, so I can try and create a PSP
implementation as well. There seems to be a larger/more active PSP community
based on my brief searching and the toolchain seems to be very modern/actively
maintained. The example I tried yesterday uses CMake and the compiler for pspdev
is gcc 11.2, which is the latest I think. Because of this I'm (knock on wood)
guessing the PSP implementation should be fairly straightforward.</p>

<h3>04/30/2022</h3>

<p>Started the psp implementation; added enough to get the gamelibhellworld triangle
drawing and camera movement working. Most of the information/psp code came from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090124081552/http://ghoti.nl/PSPtutorials.php">
https://web.archive.org/web/20090124081552/http://ghoti.nl/PSPtutorials.php
</a> and the corresponding code at
<a href="https://github.com/PSP-Archive/3D-PSP-Tutorials">
https://github.com/PSP-Archive/3D-PSP-Tutorials
</a>. Graphics using pspsdk kind of seems to be a hybrid between old/fixed function
and modern OpenGL. There aren't shaders (that I've seen), but you don't call a function
to specify each vertex point; all vertices are drawn in a single call. The matrix system
is like older OpenGL though with an internal matrix stack. Luckily, the matrix format
directly matches the GameMath cpp implementation. We can directly feed psp sdk our
GameMath matrices via:</p>
<pre><code>// set projection matrix
sceGumMatrixMode(GU_PROJECTION);
sceGumLoadIdentity();
sceGumLoadMatrix((const ScePspFMatrix4*)&amp;mProjMat.r0c0);
// set view matrix
sceGumMatrixMode(GU_VIEW);
sceGumLoadMatrix((const ScePspFMatrix4*)&amp;viewMat.r0c0);
// set model matrix
sceGumMatrixMode(GU_MODEL);
sceGumLoadMatrix((const ScePspFMatrix4*)&amp;modelMat.r0c0);
</code></pre>

<p>The direct cast works as both structures are 16 floats in column major order.
One difference I noticed is the Sce matrices are 16byte aligned.</p>

<p>Another interesting difference for the psp implementation is the required
format and order of vertex attributes. In modern OpenGL you specify each attribute
of the vertex buffer/array. For pspsdk, there is a fixed combinations of formats and
order of attributesyou can use. From the pspsdk doxygen documenation
<a href="https://pspdev.github.io/pspsdk/group__GU.html#ga7ee605d6909a72f989cae1cc4bf6264f">here</a>,
the required order (if included) is:
</p>
<pre>[vertices(1-8)] [weights (0-8)] [texture uv] [color] [normal] [vertex]</pre>
<p>So each attribute isn't required in the vertices, if an attribute is included, it
must be in this order in the data you send it.
You specify which attributes are included as an argument to <i>sceGuDrawArray()</i>.
For just having color and position attributes, the draw call looks like:</p>
<pre><code>sceGumDrawArray(
    GU_TRIANGLES,
    GU_COLOR_8888 | GU_VERTEX_32BITF | GU_TRANSFORM_3D,
    vb.mNumVertices,
    0,
    vb.mPosColorVertices
);
</code></pre>

<p>Where vb.mPosColorVertices is an array internally stored in my VertexBuffer class
where each element has the following format:</p>
<pre><code>struct PosColorVertex {
    unsigned char r, g, b, a;
    float x, y, z;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Upon VertexBuffer initialization, the input vertices are stored in mPosColorVertices
in this format, as the input vertices are x,y,z, r,g,b and need to be converted.</p>

<p>I haven't tried running the code on hardware yet - just on PPSSPP. I dusted off my PSP yesterday and
confirmed it turns on, but the battery seems to be shot and it's not recognizing the memory
stick. I ordered a new battery and memory stick which should get here sometime next week probably.
Then I'll have to go through the "jailbreaking" process again, which I don't remember how to do...</p>

<h3>05/04/2022</h3>
<p>PSP iqm anim impl working (again, at least in PPSSPP). Got the new PSP
battery in today but still waiting on the memory stick. I disabled
culling because it seems the triangle order for the IQM is backwards,
causing the front to be culled instead of the back:</p>
<img src="images/psp_culling_05_2_2022.jpg" width="500px"/><br/>

<p>Also, a TODO is use indexed rendering. I've been putting it off
because it seems that pspsdk only supports 8 and 16bit indices; for
all other implementations so far I've been using 32bit. Not sure if
restricting the size to 16bits would cause an issue yet or not. To
get around it, I've been having the VertexBuffer class upon initialization/
vertices update to convert from indexed to non-indexed vertices.</p>
<p>I ran into an issue where it seems the constructor for the
ThirdPersonPlayer class wasn't being ran properly; I had to manually
set the default settings in main() instead:</p>
<pre><code>gPlayer.SetModel(&amp;gIqm);
gPlayer.SetModelScale(GameMath::Vec3(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f));
gPlayer.SetTexture(&amp;gIqmTex);
gPlayer.GetCamera().SetDistance(15.0f);
gPlayer.SetDrawYawOffset(180.0f);
gPlayer.SetDrawPitchOffset(-90.0f);
gPlayer.Update(0.0f);
</code></pre>
<p>For the curren tresult, triangles near the edge of the view frustum seem to be
getting cut off prematurely; I think this is mentioned in the above
Ghoti tutorials to addressed later on.</p>

<h3>05/05/2022</h3>
<p>The sd card and adapater I ordered came in today, so I was able to test the
psp impl on actual hardware! To get custom firmware on the PSP, followed this
video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pZeWV5Q8E">link</a>. And
it works :)</p>

<video controls width="500px">
    <source src="images/psp_iqm_working_05_05_2022.webm" type="video/webm"/>
</video>

<p>Also added a Sprite class for 2D sprite support (see the rectangle in the
psp video above). Tested working on all systems (pc/ps3/wii/psp).
Planning on working on texture-based fonts next then music and
sound effects.</p>

<h3>05/06/2022</h3>
<p>Started texture-based font support; added PC and psp implementations.
Uses a sprite with different UV coordinates for each character.
Currently only uppercase letters are supported (although getting
lowercase to work should be really easy). Had an interesting bug
with the PSP and PS3 implementations at first. For the PC version, which I based
the psp version off of, the renderer has a single vertex buffer to
draw sprites with, composed of two triangles. Each sprite shares this
vertex buffer. For the PSP implementation, this caused previously
drawn sprites within the same frame to be overwritten/drawn over by
the latest drawn one. It seems that calls to sceGumDrawArray do not
copy the vertex data, and instead store the pointer you give it.
Thus multiple calls pointing to the same data, if that data is updated
before the actual drawing occurs, will conflict with each other. To
get around this, instead of having a single vertex buffer for sprite
drawing, there is an array of vertices, and a different index is used
for each drawn sprite. Currently I set the max to 512 sprites, which
means for texture-based font drawing, a max of 512 characters can be
drawn per frame. I did basically the same thing for PS3 as well.</p>

<h3>05/07/2022</h3>

<p>Working on background music support (Music class). PC version
working no problemo via SDL_mixer. Started PSP version and it's
been more tricky. First I tried SDL_mixer for the PSP as well,
but was getting linker related errors. Googling only really
gave one result in Japanese:
<a href="https://ameblo.jp/pspdevblog/entry-10051848541.html"/>link</a>
</p>
<pre><code>psp-fixup-imports ./IqmAnimPsp
Error, could not fixup imports, stubs out of order.
Ensure the SDK libraries are linked in last to correct this error
make: *** [Makefile:27: all] Error 1
</code></pre>

<p>So then I was looking into the psp sdk included mp3 example,
but that wasn't working for me even in PPSSPP; specifically
the function sceMp3Init was failing. Searching online
seems to show others get this error as well:
<a href="https://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?t=12021">link</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/pspdev/pspsdk/issues/17">another link</a>.
</p>

<p>So far what I have working instead is a modified version of one of
the audio wave-generation samples to stream a WAV format file instead.
I got info on the WAV file format from
<a href="https://docs.fileformat.com/audio/wav/">here.</a>
The .WAV file needs to have a sample rate of 44100Hz, and be 16bit
stereo. The nice part is it streams off of the memory stick so file
size isn't as much of an issue. Basically I have a 2048 sample buffer
that gets filled into from the .WAV file off of the memory stick every
time the audio callback needs more samples:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct WAVStreamData {
    int wavFd;
    int fileSizeBytes; // size of the data portion of the WAV file
    int fileBytesRemain; // remaining bytes of the file data portion
    unsigned char* bufPtr; // pointer into below buffer
    unsigned int bufSizeRemain; // end of buffer - bufPtr
    unsigned char buffer[2048*4]; // save 2048 samples at once
} WAVStreamData;
WAVStreamData wavStream;

/* This function gets called by pspaudiolib every time the
   audio buffer needs to be filled. The sample format is
   16-bit, stereo. */
void audioCallback(void* buf, unsigned int length, void* userdata) {
    char writeBuf[256];

    if (!wavInitSuccess) {
        return;
    }   
 
    // length = number of samples = 32bits/4bytes (left, right channel)
    int outBufBytes = length*4;
    int numBytesRemain = outBufBytes;
    unsigned char* outBuf = (unsigned char*)buf;
    while (numBytesRemain &gt; 0) {
        
        // copy buffered samples into output
        int amountBytesCopy =
            (wavStream.bufSizeRemain &gt;= numBytesRemain) ? 
            numBytesRemain :
            wavStream.bufSizeRemain;
        // assumes WAV file data is expected format, 16bit stereo, with
        // matching sample rate
        memcpy(outBuf, wavStream.bufPtr, amountBytesCopy);

        outBuf += amountBytesCopy;
        numBytesRemain -= amountBytesCopy;
        wavStream.bufPtr += amountBytesCopy;
        wavStream.bufSizeRemain -= amountBytesCopy;
        
        // get more WAV file samples if buffer is empty
        if (wavStream.bufSizeRemain == 0) {
            
            wavStream.bufPtr = wavStream.buffer;
            wavStream.bufSizeRemain = sizeof(wavStream.buffer);
            
            int numFileReadRemain = sizeof(wavStream.buffer);

                int numToRead =
                    (wavStream.fileBytesRemain &gt;= numFileReadRemain) ?
                    numFileReadRemain :
                    wavStream.fileBytesRemain;
                int numRead = sceIoRead(wavStream.wavFd, fileReadPtr, numToRead);

                    wavStream.fileBytesRemain = wavStream.fileSizeBytes;
                    
                    // re-read
                    numRead = sceIoRead(wavStream.wavFd, fileReadPtr, numToRead);
                }
                
                fileReadPtr += numRead;
                numFileReadRemain -= numRead;

<p>The full code is
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/pspdevprogs/src/master/wavAudioStream/">here</a>,
so now I just need to adapt this code into a Music class for GameLib.</p>

<h3>05/08/2022</h3>
<p>Finished PSP music implementation and Wii music implementation. The PSP version was
just slightly reworked from the above code to work with a Music class, with audioCallback
being a static function within Music, and then adding "this" as a user data parameter when
you set the callback. TODO is support multiple channels, which will be necessary for sound
effects.</p>

<pre><code>void Music::Play(const bool loop)
{
    mWavStream.looping = loop;

    // TODO - different channels
    pspAudioSetChannelCallback(
        0, // channel
        audioCallback,
        (void*)this
    );
}
void Music::audioCallback(void* buf, unsigned int length, void* userdata)
{
    Music* mus = (Music*)userdata;
    WAVHeader&amp; wavHdr = mus-&gt;mWavHdr;
    WAVStreamData&amp; wavStream = mus-&gt;mWavStream;

    if (mus-&gt;mPaused || (wavStream.ended &amp;&amp; !wavStream.looping)) {
        return;
    }
...
</code></pre>

<p>The Wii implementation requires an OGG file which I already had working previously,
just added the ability to load the file off of the sd card first instead of reading
it from a buffer.</p>

<h3>05/09/2022</h3>
<p>Added basic PS3 Music impl for WAV files. Based off of the PSP impl
except the sample rate seems to be 48000 (based off of
<a href="https://github.com/cebash/SDL_PSL1GHT/blob/stable/src/audio/psl1ght/SDL_psl1ghtaudio.c">SDL PSL1GHT port</a>),
the sample format is 32bit floats with range -1..1, and there is no given callback function.
Instead, I figured out how to do PPU threads using PSL1GHT, and have a Music thread
which updates the PS3 sound sample buffer in the background, again streaming from a file
like the PSP implementation. According to
<a href="https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/CELL_BE">here</a> the PPU has 2 cores/threads.
I made a simple Thread wrapper class based off of the PSL1GHT sample, whose basic
usage looks like:
</p>
<pre><code>void myThreadFcn(void* arg)
{
    u64 myArg = (u64)arg;
    u64 myThreadId = Thread::GetThreadId();
    while (notDone)
    {
        doStuff();
        if (notDoingAnything) {
            Thread::Yield();
        }
    }
    u64 retVal = 0;
    Thread::Exit(retVal);
}

u64 myArg = 42;
GameLib::PS3::Thread myThread;
myThread.Start(myThreadFcn, (void*)myArg, "My Thread Name");
doStuff();
u64 threadRetVal;
myThread.Join(&amp;threadRetVal);
</code></pre>

<p>GetThreadId, Yield, and Exit are static Thread class functions
to be used internally by thread functions. For the ps3 Music class,
the thread function reads raw samples from the WAV file, converts
them to big endian, and then converts them from 16bit to floating point
-1..1, and copies them into the PS3 sound buffer:
<pre><code>void Music::sThreadFcn(void* arg)
{
    Music* mus = (Music*)arg;
    WAVStreamData&amp; wavStream = mus-&gt;mWavStream;
    ...
    while (runThread)
    {
        if (wavStream.ended &amp;&amp; !wavStream.looping) {
            break;
        }
        if (mus-&gt;mPaused) {
            Thread::Yield();
            continue;
        }
        ...
        // get position of the block to write
        // 2 = 2 channels (left, right)
        float* buf = audioDataStart + (2*AUDIO_BLOCK_SAMPLES*audioBlockIndex);
        
        // fill buffer
        // samples are floating point with range -1..1
        const float sampScale = 1.0f/32768.0f;
        for (unsigned int i = 0; (i &lt; AUDIO_BLOCK_SAMPLES) &amp;&amp; runThread; ++i) {
            const int16_t leftSamp = ((int16_t*)wavStream.bufPtr)[0];
            const int16_t rightSamp = ((int16_t*)wavStream.bufPtr)[1];
            buf[i*2 + 0] = ((float)lend2bend16(leftSamp)) * sampScale;
            buf[i*2 + 1] = ((float)lend2bend16(rightSamp)) * sampScale;
        ...
    Thread::Exit(0);
}
void Music::Play(bool loop)
{
    ...
    mThread.Start(sThreadFcn, (void*)this, "Music Thread");
    ...
}
</code></pre>
</p>

<h3>05/10/2022</h3>
<p>Added sound effect class implementation for PC and Psp. Also added linux Makefile to the
iqmanimpc and gamelibhello world repositories. For the PC sound effect impl, the SDL2 mixer
Mix_Chunk object is used. For the PSP impl, it works the same as the Music class except channel 1
is used instead of channel 0. When Play() is called, the file fd is reset back to the beginning
of the wav data so each Play() call starts from the beginning. Also added a boolean value to
attempt to act as a poor man's mutex between the Sound Effect class and the audio callback function so they
don't interfere with each other. Seems to be working fine on hardware, so good enough for now.</p>

<h3>05/11/2022</h3>
<p>Added sound effect impl for PS3. Like the music class, it creates a thread to stream the .wav file,
and the thread exits when the file is out of data. What makes it different from the Music class is that
you can call Play() again and the sound effect will tell the thread to terminate if it's already
playing (by setting mRunning = false). The downside is that this means a new thread is created every
time you call Play on a sound effect. Certainly not the most efficient (it'd be better to have a
dedicated background thread), but I tested it on hardware and it works, so good enough for now. Just the Wii
sound effect implementation remaining.</p>

<h3>05/12/2022</h3>
<p>Added sound effect implementation and Thread class implementation for Wii. For sound effects, I modified
the OGG player example to work with different Wii voice channels. In this case, only two channels are used -
one for the Music class and one for the sound effect class. For threads, looking at lwp.h, which is the
libogc thread interface, and the ogg player example were enough for me to figure out generally how to implement
it. The lwp interface requires thread functions to return a void pointer, as opposed to void like the PS3
implementation. To get around this, I made a static wrapper function in the Thread class which returns void-star
and simply calls the actual desired thread function, then returns null:</p>

<pre><code>void* Thread::sThreadFcnWrapper(void* arg)
{
    Thread* thr = (Thread*)arg;
    thr-&gt;mFcn(thr-&gt;mArg);
    return (void*)0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>During its development, I was (and still am) having an issue creating and writing a text file to the SD
card for some reason. I could have sworn this worked in the past. For std::ofstream I don't seem to be getting
an error, in that is_open() returns true after supposedly opening the file. TODO is to look into that. In order
to test if my test thread was actually running, I made the thread play the test sound effect once every two seconds,
and then play the sound effect again after the thread exits if the return code is what I was expecting. That
seemed to work so I'm going to call it a success.</p>

<p>I think the next step is to start making more elaborate/complex demos using the library. I'm going
to start with a 3D jrpg demo, like what I had done for Raylib. Some other TODOs now include documentation
and adding OGG support to the PS3/PSP which only support WAV currently, and then add support for other
image formats also.</p>

<h3>05/16/2022</h3>
<p>Finished PSP thread impl and added BMP image support to PSP. Thread::Yield for psp doesn't do
anything as I haven't found a yield equivalent based on my cursory scanning of the
<a href="https://pspdev.github.io/pspsdk/group__ThreadMan.html">pspsdk doxygen</a>. Also
Thread::Exit doesn't save your return value because for some reason accessing the static
map where I would save the return value results in a invalid memory access error.</p>

<p>BMP image support for PSP I was able to get working based on the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format">Wikipedia entry</a> for
the file format, plus what I remember working on SDL 1.2 for the PS1. The only
issue I had was I needed to make sure the header structs were packed; as this was
causing the data to not be read in properly due to structure padding:</p>
<pre><code>struct Header
{
    uint16_t header; // the header field
    uint32_t filesize; // size of the file in bytes
    uint32_t reserved; // 4 bytes of reserved data (depending on the image that creates it)
    uint32_t pixOffset; // 4 bytes  offset (i.e. starting address) of where the pixmap can be found
} __attribute__((packed));

// Win32 struct (40 bytes)
struct BITMAPINFOHEADER
{
    uint32_t size;
    int32_t width;
    int32_t height;
    uint16_t planes;
    uint16_t bitCount;
    uint32_t compression;
    uint32_t sizeImage;
    int32_t xPelsPerMeter;
    int32_t yPelsPerMeter;
    uint32_t clrUsed;
    uint32_t clrImportant;
} __attribute__((packed));
</code></pre>

<p>With a test image for a sprite and tile floor:</p>
<img src="./images/psp_bmp_working_05_16_2022.jpg" width="500px"/>

<p>I've also started a RPG demo with GameLib but I haven't pushed it anywhere yet.
So far it just uses a different IQM model, but at least that means different IQM
models work :)</p>
