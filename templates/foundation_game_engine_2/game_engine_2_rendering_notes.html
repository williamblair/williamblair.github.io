<p><b>gamut</b>: the set of all colors that can be reproduced in the RGB scope</p>
<p><b>sRGB</b>: The given color value has been gamma corrected (color<sup>(1/&gamma;)</sup>)</p>
<p><b>Linear</b>: The given color value has NOT been gamma corrected</p>
<p><b>sRGB/Linear Conversion</b>: most image formats store in sRGB/gamma corrected format, but the graphics code happens in linear, then reconverted to sRGB before being displayed. 
      There is generally hardware support to automatically convert between the two.</p>
