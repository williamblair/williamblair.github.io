## USRP Radios
![USRP Diagram](usrp_diagram.png)

By default, the FPGA on the
Tx side of the USRPÂ® radio is configured to perform Digital Upconversion (DUC) to upconvert baseband
IQ samples (transferred to the device from a host computer) to an IF. The samples are converted to
continuous signals using a DAC, and then mixed with a quadrature RF carrier, performing AM-DSB-SC
modulation

## AM-DSB-SC demodulation
Can NOT be done with an envolope detector, as AM-DSB-SC does not contain a signal envolope!

## AM-DSB-TC with USRP
![USRP AM-DSB-TC](usrp_tc.png)

Same as DSB-SC except a DC offset added before mixed with carrier

## RTL-SDR AM-DSB-TC RX with envolope detector

note the second diagram is the same as the first after the bandpass filter, with
the output sent to audio and spectrum analyzers

AM-DSB-TC contains carrier components and has an information envolope, which is
why using the envolope filter works (|u|). Again AM-DSB-SC cannot be demodulated
used envolope filter. This is because the envolope filter cannot handle when
the signal polarity flips.

## AM-SSB (SUSB or AM-SLSB) RX with RTL-SDR
When the demodulating carrier frequency or phase doesn't match the original modulated
carrier, a frequency shift occurs with the result demodulated signal, and for audio
this means the pitch will be shifted up or down, with a "Donald Duck or Chipmunk effect"

## AM-DSB-TC RX on RTL-SDR with PLL or Costas demod
can use PLL or Costas instead of envolope filter

## Frequency Division Multiplexing
Split available bandwidth into channels so multiple information signals can be transmitted
at once.
Works by modulating the information signal onto its designated channel frequency band
then adding them all together.
This was used on landline phone networks to allow "tens of voice signals" on a single wire.
Each customer was assigned a 3.4kHz band; the human voice usually has a bandwidth between
100Hz and 4kHz
