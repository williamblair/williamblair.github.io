## Digital Phase Modulation Schemes

* Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK): 1 bit per symbol
    * ![BPSK Constellation](bpsk_constellation.png)
* Quaternary Phase Shift Keying (QPSK): 2 bits per symbol
    * ![QPSK Constellation](qpsk_constellation.png)
* 8-Phase Shift Keying (8PSK): 3 bits per symbol

## Digital Amplitude Modulation Schemes

* 4-position Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (4-QAM): 2 bits per symbol
* 16-position Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM): 4 bits per symbol
* 64-position Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (64-QAM): 6 bits per symbol

## Pulse Shaping
* Purpose: limit the bandwidth of the transmission
* Happens after bit-to symbol mapping above
* Have to avoid introducing inter-symbol-interference (ISI)
* Popular implementation: raised cosine filter (RC)
    * One-half implemented on transmitter end, other half implemented
      on receive end
    * Each half is a root-raised cosine filter (RRC) filter
    * When combined, the RRC filters provide zero-ISI

## Digital Upconversion and Downconversion
* Modulates and Demodulates a signal
* Additionally moves between the symbol rate f_symbol and the DAC or ADC
 sampling rate f_system
* Digital Upconverter (DUC): transmitter, f_symbol -> f_system through filtering
    * ![DUC Diagram](duc_diagram.png)
* Digital Downconverter (DDC): receiver, f_system -> f_symbol
    * ![DDC Diagram](ddc_diagram.png)
* Multirate R_multirate = f_system/f_symbol

## Carrier Synchronization
* On receive side, need to account for phase and frequency offset
  errors
    * ![Carrier Synchronization](carrier_synchronization.png)
* Phase error calculation:
    * Decision Directed: transmitted data symbols unknown, phase error
      is generated based on symbol decision (closest symbol to received
      sample)
        * Generally use this method
        * Possible that there is still phase rotation (e.g., a multiple
          of 90 degrees)
    * Data aided: receiver knows transmitted symbols, derives phase
      error based on that
