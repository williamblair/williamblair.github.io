## Rigid Hierarchical Animation
* Used in early 3D animation
* Characters are a collection of rigid pieces
  (pelvis, torso, arms, etc)
* Joints 'crack' as each piece is not flexible or
  connected
  
## Per-vertex animation and Morph Targets
* per-vertex: the vertices of the mesh are animated by
  an artist, and motion data is exported, which tells the game engine how to 
  move each vertex at runtime.
  * data intensive; little use in real-time games
* morph-target animation: vertices of a mesh are moved by
  an animator to create a relatively small set of fixed, extreme poses. Animations
  are produced by blending between two or more of these fixed poses at runtime.
  * LERP between poses
  * often used for facial animation
    * ![Morph Target Face Animation](morph_target_face.png)

## Skinned Animation
* More efficient performance and memory usage
* first used in games such as Super Mario 64
* most prevalent technique, used in both games and films
  * the dinosaurs from Jurrassic Park, Solid Snake (Metal Gear
    Solid 4), Gollum (Lord of the Rings), Nathan Drake (Uncharted), Buzz Lightyear
    (Toy Story), Marcus Fenix (Gears of War) and Joel (The Last of Us)
* Uses 'Skeleton'
  * skin is bound to the joints of the skeleton; its vertices track the movements of
    the joints. Each vertex of the skin mesh can be weighted to multiple joints, so
    the skin can stretch in a natural way as the joints move.
  * ![Skeleton and Joints Example](skeleton_joints.png)
* Skeletons made out of joints
* Joints made out of
  * joint name (string or hash)
  * parent joint index
  * Inverse bind pose transform matrix: position, orientation, etc. of the joint

## Bind pose/rest pose/T-pose
* Base pose prior to binding/transformation/movement
* ![Bind Pose](t_pose.png)

## Local pose
* Each joint pose is a transformation relative to its parent joint
  * an affine transform
* Can be stored as a 3 entry struct (R,T,S):
  * rotation quaternion (R)
  * translation vector (T)
  * Scale value (for uniform scaling) or vector (non-uniform scaling) (S)
* Poses can be represented in world-space coordinates using a 'global pose'
  transformation matrix
  
## Clip
* A single animation sequence
* Usually a well defined action such as walk, run, throw, etc.
* Can affect a single set of joints in the character (such as an arm)
* Game character movements are typically broken down into literally
  thousands of clips
  
## Timelines
* Represent the animation over time
* Key poses/key frames are present within the timeline with
  linear interpolation (LERP) blending between them
* ![Key Poses](key_poses.png)
* Slow motion/playing in reverse/etc. is just a matter of 
  expanding/compressing/reversing the timeline
* Mixing multiple clips requires normalizing their timelines
  if the clips each have different base durations in order to remain
  in sync
  * ![Normalized Local Time](normalized_time.png)

## Frames and Samples
* A 'frame' is a time period, e.g. 1/30 or 1/60 seconds
* A 'sample' is a single point in time
* ![Frames and samples](frames_and_samples.png)

## Clock synchronization
* A global clock can be used to synchronize multiple animations
  between multiple characters
* ![Global Clock Timeline](global_clock.png)

## Animation data storage format
* The animation data can contain things besides joint poses,
  called 'metachannels'
  * Event triggers
  * locators
  * texture coordinate scrolling
  * texture animation
  * animated material parameters
  * animated lighting parameters
  * any other parameters that need to change over time and are in some way
    synchronized with an animation.
* Can be stored in code via the following UML:
  * ![Animation UML](animation_uml.png)

## Skinning
* Attaching the vertices of a 3D mesh to a posed skeleton
* Each vertex is bound to one or more joints, with a weight
  associated with each joint (the 'weighting factor')
* Uses a 'skinning matrix' to transform the vertices relative
  to the joint poses
* ![Vertex Skinning Transform](vertex_skinning_transform.png)

## LERP blending
* Used to combine multiple animations which affect the same
  joints
* Temporal Interpolation: used to find the location in between
  non-integer frame indices
* Cross Fading: blending between the end of one animation and the
  beginning of another in order to achieve a smooth transition
  * ![Smooth Transition](smooth_transition.png)
  * ![Freeze Transition](freeze_transition.png)
* Directional Locomotion: To blend animations when the character
  is both turning and moving at the same time
  * Targeted or pivoting movement
  * ![Targeted and Pivoting Movement](targeted_and_pivoting_movement.png)

## Additive Blending/Additive Animation Clips

* Uses a 'difference clip'/'additive animation clip' which contains
  the changes needed to move from a 'reference clip' into a 'source
  clip'
  * D = S - R
* Once a difference clip is calculated, it can be used on other unrelated
  clips, not just the original reference
* Weaknesses: Tends to over-rotate the joints in a skeleton, especially
  when multiple difference clips are combined
  * Keep hip rotations to a minimum in the reference clip.
  * The shoulder and elbow joints should usually be in neutral poses in the
    reference clip to minimize over-rotation of the arms when the difference
    clip is added to other targets.
  * Animators should create a new difference animation for each core pose
    (e.g., standing upright, crouched down, lying prone, etc.). This allows
    the animator to account for the way in which a real human would move
    when in each of these stances.

## Applications of additive blending
* Stance Variation
  * ![Stance Variation](stance_variation.png)
* Locomotion Noise
  * ![Locomotion Noise](locomotion_noise.png)
* Aim and Look At
  * ![Aim and Look At](aim_and_look_at.png)
* Overloading the time axis

## Procedural Animations (animation Post Processing)
* Animations generated/calculated at run time
  * Bounce vehicle when driving
  * Sway trees and bushes with wind

## Inverse Kinematics (animation post processing)
* Attempts to lock a joint to a target location
  * e.g. a hand picks up an object
* Uses error minimization to find the closest possible
  location
  * ![Inverse Kinematics Error](inverse_kinematics_error.png)

## Rag Dolls (Animation post processing)
* Physically simulated rigid bodies (limp/lifeless)

## Data compression techniques
* Things to do to save memory/disk space:
  * Channel omission (e.g. channels which do not change over time)
  * Quantization (reduce size of each channel, e.g. 32 to 16 bits)
  * Sampling Frequency/Key Omission (reduce sample rate/omit some samples)
  * Curved based compression (calculates B-splines based on sample data
    and stores the generated function instead)
	* ![B Splines graph](b_splines_graph.png)
  * Wavelet compression (split animation curve into sum or orthonormal wavelets)
  * Selective Loading/Streaming

## Animation Pipeline
![Animation Pipeline](animation_pipeline.png)

## Action State Machines
* Used to abstract the current 'state' of movement in the character
  (e.g. running, walking, etc.)
* Each state has its own animation (e.g. idle animation, etc.)
* Ensures smooth transition between states
* Each state machine exists in a separate state layer
  * ![Layered Action State Machine](layered_asm.png)
* All current clips on the same character can be combined via a
  flat weighted average or blend trees
  * ![Blend Trees](blend_trees.png)
* Naughty dog engine uses Scheme script to define state machines

        (define-state complex

                    )
                    (anim-node-clip "move-b-look-ud")
                )
        )

## Transitions between states
* Parameters:
  * Source and Destination states
  * Transition type (immediate, cross faded, etc.?)
  * Duration
  * Ease in/ease out curve
  * transition window (time when transition is valid)
* Transition matrix: represents the valid states that can
  be transitioned between (e.g. walk to run is a valid transition)  
  * In Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault, the matrix was represented
    via wildcard naming

        <transitions>
            <!-- global default -->
            <trans from="\*" to="\*" type=frozen duration=0.2>
            <!-- default for any walk to any run -->
            <trans from="walk\*" to="run\*" type=smooth duration=0.15>
           <!-- special handling from any prone to any getting-up
             -- action (only valid from 2 sec to 7.5 sec on the
             -- local timeline) -->
            <trans from="\*prone" to="\*get-up" type=smooth duration=0.1 window-start=2.0 window-end=7.5>
            ...
        </transitions>
  
  * Uncharted/Naughty Dog Used Scheme definitions:
  
        (define-state complex
          :name "s_turret-idle"
          :tree (aim-tree
                    (anim-node-clip "turret-aim-all--base")

            (transition-end "s_turret-idle")
          )
        )

## Attachments
* Used to constrain a joint within an area/range,
  e.g. to within a parent joint's range of movement
  * stored just like regular joints
  * ![Attachment](attachment.png)
  
## Reference Locator
* A common reference point used to orient
  multiple animated characters  
  * ![Reference Locator](reference_locator.png)
  
## Hand and foot inverse kinematics
* Used to make sure hand grabbing/foot movement
  along ground looks realistic
* Usually can be enabled or disabled within the animation
  pipeline
* Well suited for minor corrections if the joint is near the
  target
* Does not necessarily ensure proper orientation
  * May have significant performance costs
  * May not necessarily 'feel' realistic/fun to play
  
## Other movement constraints

* Look-at
* Cover-registration (align the character behind 'cover' objects)  
* Cover entry and departure
* Traversal aids (guided movement through an area/obstacle(s))
