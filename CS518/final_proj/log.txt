Research:
    - Sony PS3 Linux Kit - Cell BE toolkit - used for PS3s processor
        i.   explanation pdf here: http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/cluster/ps3/CBE_SDK_Guide_1.1.pdf
        ii.  Can also be run (I believe) on linux on a pc, has a 
             'Full system simulator'
        iii. Fat PS3 $90 gamestop

    - SPE programming - part of Cell programming

        i. (chp 3) - https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/geoff/cell/ps3-linux-docs/CellProgrammingTutorial/BasicsOfSPEProgramming.html

    - PS2 - not alot of info on ps2 cluster, says used official
       ps2 linux kit

Installing IBM Cell/B.E. 2.1 SDK (on pc)
-Download Fedora core 6 x86 iso, to be virtualized
    - https://archive.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/core/6/i386/iso/
        i. downloaded FC-6-i386-DVD.iso
    - installed on VirtualBox
-Found ps3 example SPE graphics code here (japanese article):

Installing Linux on PS3 CFW
- First Tried Yellow Dog Linux (Comes with IBM cell SDK built in)
    - Failed to install via USB due to issue finding boot image
- Install Red Ribbon Linux (Debian)
    - Boots successfully via USB
        i. Installed to a 32gb flash drive (not optimal, yes, but
           easier than partitioning the ps3 hard drive)
    - Cell 3.1 SDK can be installed via converted RPMs to DEBs from here:
        https://github.com/aethyx/ps3linux/tree/master/Cell%20SDK%203.1%20for%20Debian%20Jessie
        - had to install chkconfig for elfspe2
            sudo apt-get install chkconfig
        - elfspe2 fails to install properly regardless
        - DEBs fail to install properly (ppu-gcc doesn't work)
- Yellow Dog Linux install via DVD
    - Run ps3 [video mode] install from petiteboot
        - DVD only recognized if petiteboot selected from the
          rebug tools menu

        - add these as additional repos during install?:
        ftp://ftp.kddlabs.co.jp/Linux/packages/yellowdog/yum/6.1/base/
        ftp://ftp.kddlabs.co.jp/Linux/packages/yellowdog/yum/6.1/extras/
       
        - still have failing to find rpm's issue (maybe iso/cd burn issue?) 

02/12/18
--------
8:00am-11:00am, 10:30pm-12:30am
- Fedora Core 9 DVD install
    - DVD only recognized if Red Ribbon Live USB also inserted
      (probably any recognizable USB would do it I imagine)
    - Having the other Red Ribbon USB messed up the install
       i. installation seemed to go fine, butn when booting from
          petiteboot it was looking for the boot image, root, etc.
          on the red ribbon flash drive (/dev/sde), not our installed 
          flash drive (/dev/sdd)

6:00am-6:30am, 4:15pm-5:15pm, 6:30pm-7:45pm, 8:30pm-10:30pm
- Fedora Core 9 DVD successfully installed on single usb 
    - Just have one usb with Red Ribbon on it and overwrite it during
      install
- Found Cell 3.1 SDK here (hard to find anywhere else, many dead links):
    - https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/reg/download.do?source=cellsdk&S_PKG=fedora&S_TACT=105AGX16&S_CMP=LP&lang=en_US&cp=UTF-8

    - need an IBM account (free)
- Installed SDK on PS3 following instructions for Fedora 9 from here:
    - http://www.iman1.jo/iman1/images/IMAN1-User-Site-Files/Installation/SDK-Installation_Guide_v3.1.pdf
- Ran hello world code from here:
