Research:
    - Sony PS3 Linux Kit - Cell BE toolkit - used for PS3s processor
        i.   explanation pdf here: http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/cluster/ps3/CBE_SDK_Guide_1.1.pdf
        ii.  Can also be run (I believe) on linux on a pc, has a 
             'Full system simulator'
        iii. Fat PS3 $90 gamestop

    - SPE programming - part of Cell programming

        i. (chp 3) - https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/geoff/cell/ps3-linux-docs/CellProgrammingTutorial/BasicsOfSPEProgramming.html

    - PS2 - not alot of info on ps2 cluster, says used official
       ps2 linux kit

1:00pm-1:38pm
Installing IBM Cell/B.E. 2.1 SDK (on pc)
-Download Fedora core 6 x86 iso, to be virtualized
    - https://archive.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/core/6/i386/iso/
        i. downloaded FC-6-i386-DVD.iso
    - installed on VirtualBox
-Found ps3 example SPE graphics code here (japanese article):

10:00pm-2:00am
Installing CFW for OFW 4.82 on PS3 (so can install linux)
- Exploit guide (mix of info from all):

--------
2:30pm-5:00pm, 6:30pm-10:30pm, 11:30pm-1:30am
Installing Linux on PS3 CFW
- First Tried Yellow Dog Linux (Comes with IBM cell SDK built in)
    - Failed to install via USB due to issue finding boot image
- Install Red Ribbon Linux (Debian)
    - Boots successfully via USB
        i. Installed to a 32gb flash drive (not optimal, yes, but
           easier than partitioning the ps3 hard drive)
    - Cell 3.1 SDK can be installed via converted RPMs to DEBs from here:
        https://github.com/aethyx/ps3linux/tree/master/Cell%20SDK%203.1%20for%20Debian%20Jessie
        - had to install chkconfig for elfspe2
            sudo apt-get install chkconfig
        - elfspe2 fails to install properly regardless
        - DEBs fail to install properly (ppu-gcc doesn't work)
- Yellow Dog Linux install via DVD
    - Run ps3 [video mode] install from petiteboot
        - DVD only recognized if petiteboot selected from the
          rebug tools menu

        - add these as additional repos during install?:
        ftp://ftp.kddlabs.co.jp/Linux/packages/yellowdog/yum/6.1/base/
        ftp://ftp.kddlabs.co.jp/Linux/packages/yellowdog/yum/6.1/extras/
       
        - still have failing to find rpm's issue (maybe iso/cd burn issue?) 

02/12/18
--------
8:00am-11:00am, 10:30pm-12:30am
- Fedora Core 9 DVD install
    - DVD only recognized if Red Ribbon Live USB also inserted
      (probably any recognizable USB would do it I imagine)
    - Having the other Red Ribbon USB messed up the install
       i. installation seemed to go fine, butn when booting from
          petiteboot it was looking for the boot image, root, etc.
          on the red ribbon flash drive (/dev/sde), not our installed 
          flash drive (/dev/sdd)

02/13/18
--------
6:00am-6:30am, 4:15pm-5:15pm, 6:30pm-7:45pm, 8:30pm-10:30pm
- Fedora Core 9 DVD successfully installed on single usb 
    - Just have one usb with Red Ribbon on it and overwrite it during
      install
- Found Cell 3.1 SDK here (hard to find anywhere else, many dead links):
    - https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/reg/download.do?source=cellsdk&S_PKG=fedora&S_TACT=105AGX16&S_CMP=LP&lang=en_US&cp=UTF-8

    - need an IBM account (free)
- Installed SDK on PS3 following instructions for Fedora 9 from here:
    - http://www.iman1.jo/iman1/images/IMAN1-User-Site-Files/Installation/SDK-Installation_Guide_v3.1.pdf
- Ran hello world code from here:
     - https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/geoff/cell/ps3-linux-docs/CellProgrammingTutorial/BasicsOfSIMDProgramming.html

02/15/18
--------
9:30am-11:00am, 8:30pm-9:30pm
- Followed tutorial code from here:
    - https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/geoff/cell/ps3-linux-docs/CellProgrammingTutorial/BasicsOfSIMDProgramming.html
- SIMD vector addition, Matrix transpose calc, abs. difference calc     

02/21/18
--------
09:30am-11:00am
- Continued following tutorial code from previous entry (02/15)
    - SIMD partial sum, short->float conversion, basic spe threads/
      execution
- Copied Cell 3.1 Docs from ps3 to website here:
    - https://web.cs.sunyit.edu/~blairw/CellSDK3.1Docs/

02/26/18
--------
9:30am-11:00am
- Installing SDK on virtualbox (in order to test IBM 'Full system simulator'

02/27/18
--------
9:30am-11:00am, 12:30pm-1:30pm, 6:30pm-7:30pm, 9:00pm-9:30pm
- Installed Eclipse IDE on virtual machine for development environment
- The Simulator comes separately from the SDK now (of course it does,
  why would it be easy?)
    - Found here?
      http://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/Cell_Programming_IBM
    - Also this site looks like it has some good links...
- Uploaded and shared files to google drive for organized/central
  location since everything is hard to find

02/28/18
--------
9:30am-11:00am
- Running simulator in IDE (Eclipse)
    - Weird error according to docs: have to run
        echo "Welcome to Fedora Core"
        echo "INIT: Entering runlevel: 2"
      in the eclipse console, apparently the simulator
      waits for this message before continuing
- Following IDE tutorial from here:
   https://web.cs.sunyit.edu/~blairw/CellSDK3.1Docs/programming/IDE_Users_Guide_v3.1.pdf

03/01/18
--------
12:30pm-2:00pm
- Looked at Blue-Steel project:
    http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cag/ps3/blue-steel.shtml
- Fails to compile with given makefile - meant for cell sdk 2, not 3,
  on Yellow Dog Linux

03/03/18
--------
4:00pm-5:00pm, 6:00pm-7:00pm
- Followed Cell Simulator Guide Here:
    http://ww2.cs.fsu.edu/~west/cell/index.php?tutorial=configfirst
- For using the simulator with command line tools as opposed to IDE

03/06/18
--------
8:45pm-9:30pm
- Followed IBM Cell SDK 3.1 programming tutorial/guide here (basic spe thread creation):
    https://web.cs.sunyit.edu/~blairw/CellSDK3.1Docs/programming/CBE_Programming_Tutorial_v3.1.pdf

03/07/18
--------
3:00pm-4:00pm, 6:00pm-8:00pm
- Followed IBM Cell SDK 3.1 programming tutorial/guide from yesterday
  (Euler particle simulation - example from scalar to SPE parallelism)
- Found good altivec/PPU SIMD functions reference:
    https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/ALTIVECPIM.pdf?&srch=1

03/09/18
--------
11:00am-12:00pm, 1:00pm-3:00pm
- Set up Cell SDK in Codelite IDE
- Followed DMA transfer tutorial here:
    https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/geoff/cell/ps3-linux-docs/CellProgrammingTutorial/BasicsOfSPEProgramming.html

03/10/18
--------
8:00pm-10:00pm
- Continued to follow same DMA transfer tutorial as yesterday; this time
  ran on multiple SPEs and used SPU intrinsics

03/12/18
--------
10:00am-11:00am
- Looked at Blue-Steel code

03/31/18
--------
3:00pm-5:00pm
- Looked at more Blue Steel Code
- Started looking at multiple video streaming assignment here:
    http://www.es.ele.tue.nl/~heco/courses/PlatformDesign/Cell-assignment/index.html

04/01/18
--------
7:30pm-8:30pm, 9:30pm-11:00pm
- Looked at Blue Steel Code
    - Apparently Drawing to the screen is done through 
      the PS3 Linux built in ps3 framebuffer lib?
        - header asm/ps3fb.h, linux/fb.h
    - look at blue steel source file src/fb.cpp (frame buffer)

- Successfully drew to the screen from console using linux frame buffer,
  code from here:
    http://betteros.org/tut/graphics1.php#fbdev

04/04/18
--------
8:00pm-10:00pm
- Began implementing serial version of Conway's Game of Life on Cell PPU

04/05/18
--------
12:30pm-1:30pm, 5:30pm-8:00pm
- Finished Serial Conway's Game of Life, Began Parallel Version
    - Noted - align 16 on data parameters to the SPE is important!
    - will get a Bus Error without it

- TODO - follow this signaling tutorial:
    - http://ww2.cs.fsu.edu/~west/cell/index.php?tutorial=mailsignal
    - That way can synchronize all of the SPEs to wait for all
      of the others before moving to the next generation (otherwise
      can have concurrency issues...)

04/08/18
--------
2:00pm-5:00pm, 6:30pm-8:00pm, 9:30-11:00pm
- Have 8 SPE threads running on parallel version (just skeleton),
  facing concurrency issue w/ splitting up the matrix (multiple threads
  receiving same part of matrix)

04/11/18
--------
9:30am-11:00am, 8:30pm-11:00pm
- Fixed concurrency issue (create SPE args within the pthread function)
- added writing to output array from SPE
- Program can now calculate the total next generation on SPEs
    - TODO - add multiple generations

04/12/18
--------
6:00pm-8:00pm
- Added multiple generations calculation
- Started comparing results to serial version
    - serial version seriously outperforms parallel version
    - to little data to work on/compute relative to the time
      to send data and wait for threads to finish (concurrency)
