<h1>RenderWare 3.5 and SCE PS2 SDK Setup</h1>

<img src="images/renderwarelogo.jpeg"/><br/>

<p>Found this <a href="https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10167&sid=bbe12fff1e3f60ca33e17c31dededf88">forum post</a>
showing that a version of the RenderWare SDK for the PS2 is contained within the game disc for
"Bloody Roar 4" as dummy data to expand the disk image size.
RenderWare was a very popular cross-platform game engine/SDK used on a bunch of popular PS2 titles; I
watched an interesting youtube video on it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKpDFIWK1DI">link</a></p>

<p>I've been experimenting with it and thought I'd document the setup process as they don't really go over
it in the forum post.</p>

<p>In order to program new stuff with the SDK, the compiler needs to be provided separately (the RenderWare SDK
 in terms of code is just a library). After some more searching, I found a version of the official SONY compiler
and libraries <a href="https://archive.org/details/PlayStation2July2005SDKversion3.0.3">here</a>. This provides
a disk image that contains a Windows installer.</p>

<p>Loading up a Windows XP VM and inserting the disk image into the VM, we can run the installer:</p>

<ul>
    <li><img src="images/ps2sdkinstall1.png"/></li>
    <li><img src="images/ps2sdkinstall2.png"/></li>
    <li><img src="images/ps2sdkinstall3.png"/></li>
</ul>

<p>This places the compiler, library, tools, and documentation in C:\usr\local\sce. Oddly
the compiler and library are for unix/linux, NOT Windows, so while some of the tool programs
can run in the XP VM, the actual compiler needs to be run on a 32-bit Unix/Linux system.</p>

<p>So I copied the entire C:\usr\local\sce directory onto my host machine via a shared folder
and installed a new Ubuntu 16.04 32-bit VM, and re-copied the folder into /usr/local/sce.
I also changed permissions on the folder in /usr/local so I can modify it without root access:</p>
<pre><code>sudo chown -R bj /usr/local/sce
sudo chgrp -R bj /usr/local/sce</code></pre>

<p>Next, looking at the SCE PS2 SDK guide pdf in /usr/local/sce/1st_read/setup_3.0.pdf,
It says the following directories need to be in our PATH environment variable:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/local/sce/bin
/usr/local/sce/ee/gcc/bin
/usr/local/sce/iop/gcc/bin
</code></pre>
<p>To accomplish this I added the following to the VM's ~/.bashrc</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/usr/local/sce/bin:/usr/local/sce/ee/gcc/bin:/usr/local/sce/iop/gcc/bin:$PATH
</code></pre>
<p>I can now run the compiler, ee-gcc, which outputs the following version:</p>
<pre><code>bj@bj-VirtualBox:~$ ee-gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/local/sce/ee/gcc/lib/gcc-lib/ee/3.2-ee-040921/specs
Configured with: ../src/configure --prefix=/usr/local/sce/ee/gcc --target=ee --enable-c-cpplib --without-sim --disable-sim --enable-c-mbchar --enable-threads
Thread model: eekernel
gcc version 3.2-ee-040921
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the compiler's installed, we can get back to installing the RenderWare SDK.
Booting up the Windows XP VM again and mounting a Bloody Roar 4 disk image, we can inspect
its contents, and extract the SDK installer following the forum link instructions:</p>

<ul>
<li><img src="images/bloodyroar1.png"/></li>
<li><img src="images/bloodyroar2.png"/></li>
<li><img src="images/bloodyroar3.png"/></li>
<li><img src="images/bloodyroar4.png"/></li>
<li><img src="images/bloodyroar5.png"/></li>
<li><img src="images/bloodyroar6.png"/></li>
<li><img src="images/bloodyroar7.png"/></li>
</ul>

<p>The resulting contents are put in C:\RW. I then copied that entire RW folder onto
my host machine again via a shared folder. Next is to boot the Ubuntu 16 VM again and copy
the RW folder onto that.</p>

<p>To figure out what to do next I was able to look at the RenderWare build documentation
from a different available RenderWare SDK from 
<a href="https://archive.org/details/renderwaregraphics3.7sdkandstudio2.01">here</a>, which
includes a windows installer, so I installed that back on the windows XP VM and copied the
files back onto my host again. The important file out of this was
RW/Graphics/docs/whitepapers/BuildRW.pdf which contains instructions for building the RenderWare
libraries from source. Fortunately the version inside of Bloody Roar is pre-compiled for
a Unix/Linux env, but BuildRW.pdf contains documentation on the options.mak file and what
each entry means. Not sure why, but it shows that the RenderWare sdk refers to the PS2
targets/platforms as 'sky' and 'sky2'.
</p>

<p>Testing compiling one of the sample applications, I had to modify the options.mak
file in RW/Graphics/examples to set the full path of RWGSDK:</p>
<pre><code>RWGSDK=/home/bj/RWsdkBR4/RW/Graphics/rwsdk
RWTARGET=sky2
RWOS=sky
RWCOMPILER=skygcc
RWDEBUG=0
RWMETRICS=0
RWLOGO=1
RWSPLASH=0
RWMOUSE=1
CDEBUG=1
DXSDK=c:/mssdk
OGLLIBPATH=c:/ogllib
IOPPATH=/usr/local/sce/iop
XBOXSDK=c:/Progra~1/Micros~3
APPLEGLSDKPATH=c:/aoglsdk
</code></pre>

<p>And I set the RWOPTIONS env var in my .bashrc:</p>
<pre><code>export RWOPTIONS=/home/bj/RWsdkBR4/RW/Graphics/options.mak</code></pre>

<p>A few of the examples I looked at try and load files from the host system (as in
a pc connected to the PS2 over network), so they would need some modifcation to load
from cd/dvd instead. The animation example I tried starts up fine in PCSX2 but of course
fails to load anything. The blending example however seems to work fine (again
in PCSX2):</p>

<p>Now I've been reading some of the included documentation and following the RenderWare
user guide. The most useful files have been UserGuideVol1.pdf in RW/Graphics/docs/userguide,
RW/Graphics/docs/apireference/sky2.chm, and the pdfs in /usr/local/sce/doc/ee. My main goal
is to figure out how to initialize and load files off the cd in order to get the bigger
examples working.</p>
