## Frequency Modulation (FM)

Manipulates frequency instead of amplitude. The amplitude of the
information signal causes the resulting modulated signal frequency
to increase (higher amplitude) or decrease (lower amplitude).

## Modulation Index and Signal Bandwidth (&Beta;<sub>fm</sub>)

* Frequency modulation can either be narrowband or sideband
* Narrowband if the modulation index &Beta;<sub>fm</sub> << 1
  * ![Narrowband Frequencies](narrowband.png)
  * ![Narrowband Frequencies generation in Matlab](narrowband_matlab.png)
* Wideband if the modulation index &Beta;<sub>fm</sub> >> 1
  * This is what FM radio stations use
  * Carson's Rule: The bandwidth of a wide band FM signal can
    be approximated as (2 \* num\_sidebands \* info frequency).
    The number of sidebands can be replaced with &Beta;<sub>fm</sub>+1
    which equals 2\*(&delta;f + f<sub>i</sub>) Hz

    * Note the matlab circuit is exactly the same as narrowband except
      the modulation index is larger

## Differential Demodulation

* Take the derivative of the received signal

## Receiving FM into Complex Baseband
* Quadrature Demodulation

## Complex Differentiation Discriminator (Non-coherent Demodulation)
 
* Demodulates the real and imaginary component separately
* Digital Version uses a differentiator, with FIR filters
  with components -1,0,1 or 1,-1

  * When combined:

## Complex Delay Line Discriminator

* Simpler version of above that demodulates the real and imaginary
  components in parallel

## Phased Locked Loop Demodulator (Coherent demodulation)

* Just uses the real component of the signal
* ![PLL Demodulator](pll_demodulator.png)

## Other concerns specific to commercial FM radio

* De-emphasis filtering
  * need to filter a 'pre-emphasis' which was added to the signal
    before transmission. The pre-emphasis filters signals
    above a certain frequency in order to maintain the modulation index
    and signal bandwidth.
* De-multiplexing the signal
  * The received commercial FM signal is multiplexed and contains mono,
    stereo, and a 'pilot' component, as well as possibly RDS
    digital information stream (song title, station, etc.)
