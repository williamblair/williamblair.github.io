<h1>Chapter 7 - Frequency Tuning and Simple Synchronization</h1>

<h3>Tuning</h3>
<p>Select a frequency band of interest and capture/receive signals within
that band. Center frequency is the local oscillator (LO). Bandwidth set
by filtering and setting of sample rate</p>

<h3>Synchronization</h3>
<p>The need to correct for differences in time/frequency (e.g.
frequency difference of the carrier signal)
</p>

<h3>Channel Effects</h3>
<p>Radio signals go through attenuation, noise, interference, fixed or time
varying propogation delay (translates into a phase shift of &theta; degrees), 
and multipath propogation. If the transmitter/receiver are moving, the 
propogation delay can increase or decrease over time (translates into a 
frequency shift ("doppler shift")).</p>

<h3>Phase Locked Loops (PLLs)</h3>
<p>Are able to recreate an input sinusoid, track deviations in its frequency, and reject
noise. Obtains "Phaselock" when the output PLL sine wave converges to the same original
TX signal frequency (not necessarily same PHASE, but same FREQUENCY).</p>
<p>Made up of 3 components:
<ul>
<li>Phase Detector: generates a varying signal based on the phase difference of rx and
locally generated sin wave. Calculates "Phase Error" = &theta;<sub>e</sub>(t).
In the diagram &theta;_i = input phase, &theta;_o = local oscillator phase.
K_p is a scalar phase detector gain value. The phase error approaches 0 as 
the PLL output signal approaches the original intended TX signal.</li>
<li>Controllable Oscillator: A VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) (analogue) 
or NCO (Numerically Controlled Oscillator) (digital) which generates
a sin output with phase/frequency based on its input. The filtered phase
error is input, and "the larger the error, the larger the adjustment applied"</li>
<li>Loop Filter: removes high frequency from phase detector and outputs to the VCO/NCO</li>
</ul>

<h3>Carrier Synchronization for transmitted carrier AM (AM-DSB-TC)</h3>
<p>Coherent RX extracts the transmitted carrier component and uses it
to demodulate to baseband. Done using a PLL with the carrier as the input
reference signal.</p>

<h3>Carrier Synchronization for supressed carrier AM (AM-DSB-SC)</h3>
<p>for SC, the carrier is not explicitly present. Have to recover the
carrier from the modulated RX signal, then demodulate. Commonly
used way to do this is the "Costas Loop." </p>
