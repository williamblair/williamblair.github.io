<h1>Chapter 5 - Complex Signals, Spectra, and Quadrature Modulation</h1>

<h3>Euler's Formula and other sines/cosines</h3>
<p>e<sup>jwt</sup> = cos(wt) + j*sin(wt)</p>
<p>cos(wt) = (e<sup>jwt</sup> + e<sup>-jwt</sup>)/2</p>
<p>sin(wt) = (e<sup>jwt</sup> - e<sup>-jwt</sup>)/2</p>
<p>cos(a)cos(b) = 0.5*cos(a+b) + 0.5*cos(a-b)</p>

<h3>Amplitude, magnitude, and phase of a 3 component signal</h3>
<p>signal composed of three sine waves, with frequencies 100Hz, 200Hz and 300Hz, and
respective amplitudes, 10, 1, and 4</p>

<h3>Spectral Leakage</h3>
<p>When performing FFT, if number of bins and sample frequency don't line up to exactly
match a frequency component (e.g. if bins at a step of 10 Hz but your frequency is say 12 Hz),
the result is data getting split up into the closest/nearby bins. e.g. (first no leakage, second leakage):

<h3>Converting sin/cos representation to complex frequency representation</h3>
<p>Using cos(wt) = (e<sup>jwt</sup> + e<sup>-jwt</sup>)/2:</p>
<img src="cos_to_complex.png"/>
<p>The resulting plot looks like:</p>

<h3>Phase offset and resulting graph</h3>
<p>Offsets are pi/4, pi/6, and none</p>

<h3>Complex frequency represenation, with phase shifts (so I and Q are different now)</h3>
<img src="complex_phase_eq.png"/>
<p>This resulting graph is the "magnitude spectra" - gives the magnitude component at each
   complex exponential value</p>
<img src="magnitude_spectra.png"/>

<h3>Quadrature Signals</h3>
<p>Two independant or separate 'phases' of data are transmitted (modulating two
independant baseband information signals onto sine and cosine carriers at the same 
frequency)</p>

<h3>Double Sideband Supressed Carrier Amplitude Modulation</h3>
<p>The desired baseband signal, g(t), is "modulated" (in this case
multiplied by) a high frequency carrier signal, c(t). So the resulting
modulated signal s(t) = c(t)*g(t)
</p>
<p>Demodulation is done by multipliying the received signal again with
   the carrier signal c(t): x(t) = c(t)*s(t) = c(t)*(c(t)*g(t)) then sending the 
   output through a low pass filter
</p>
<p>This doesnt include phase locking and carrier synchronization, which is required
if the receiever doesnt have the exact same frequency and phase (which is most often)
</p>
<p>If the phases dont match (e.g. the receiver has a phase offset of &theta;, 
the resulting demodulated signal will have an extra cos(&theta;) in its amplitude
(e.g. the demodulated signal is (A/2)g(t)cos(&theta;) instead of (A/2)g(t)</p>

<h3>Quadrature Modulation and Demodulation (QAM)</h3>
<p>Uses complex representation. Requires less bandwidth than amplitude modulation
(which requires 2f Hz to transmit a f Hz signal). In this case we send to signals
at frequency f at different phases, e.g. 90 degrees apart. One is a sine wave
and the other is a cosine wave</p>
<p>The cosine channel is In-Phase (I) ('real'), the sine channel is Quadrature Phase
(Q) ('imaginary'). The sine value is -sin(2*pi*f*t) = cos(2*pi*f*t + pi/2). Notice
the cosine version is 90 degrees phase offset from the cos (in-phase) signal</p>

<p>To modulate, baseband signal g1(t) is multiplied by the in phase (cos/I) component,
  the baseband signal g2(t) is multiplied by the quadrature (-sin/Q) component,
then their results are added together</p>
<p>The final result is y(t) = g1(t)*cos(2*pi*f*t) - g2(t)*sin(2*pi*f*t)</p>

<p>To demodulate, you extract the in phase g1(t) by multiplying the input signal
by the cosine component (I), and extract the quadrature g2(t) by multiplying
the input signal by the -sin (Q) component. Both outputs have to then go through
a lowpass filter.</p>
<p>Again, non-matching rx phase and frequency must also be accounted for</p>

<h3>QAM using complex notation</h3>

<p>use g(t) = g1(t) + j*g2(t)</p>
<p>The modulated signal v(t) = g(t)*e<sup>j*2*pi*f*t</sup>, which contains
a real and imaginary component. The final transmitted signal y(t) is the real
component only of v(t) (the imaginary component is dropped), which turns out
to be the same as the above non-complex method 
(y(t) = g1(t)*cos(2*pi*f*t) - g2(t)*sin(2*pi*f*t)</p>

<p>Demodulation is done by multiplying the received by e<sup>-j*2*pi*f*t</sup>
(same as for modulation except j is negative), then sending the output through
a lowpass filter</p>

<h3>Frequency Offset Error Correction</h3>
<p>for if the receiving signal has a slight offset: f + f<sub>&Delta;</sub>
instead of just f</p>
<p>Then the receiver demodulated is x(t) = y(t)e<sup>-j*2*pi*(f+f<sub>&Delta;</sub>)*t</sup></p>
<p>= [g1(t)cos(2*pi*f*t)-g2(t)sin(2*pi*f*t)]*e<sup>-j*2*pi*f*t</sup>*e<sup>-j*2*pi*f<sub>&Delta;</sub>*t</sup></p>
<p>The last *e component is extra due to the frequency offset, meaning we have been shifted by
that amount on the frequency spectrum</p>
<p>The solution then to correct is to shift the demodulated signal by the opposite: multiply by the same
extra e component except use +j instead of -j. The process is shown below:</p>
