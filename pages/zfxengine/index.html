        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <h3>07/31/2022</h3>
        <p>The book uses Visual Studio inline assembly syntax (__asm) for
        AVX instructions and AVX cpu detection. I instead used GCC inline
        asm with AT&amp;T syntax
        (<a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/GCC-Inline-Assembly-HOWTO.html">
            https://www.ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/GCC-Inline-Assembly-HOWTO.html</a>)
        and then <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#">intrinsics</a>. Example:</p>

        <pre><code>// book inline asm vector normalize:
w = 0.0f;
__asm {
    mov    esi,   this            ; vector u
    movups xmm0,  [esi]           ; first vector in xmm0
    movaps xmm2,  xmm0            ; copy original vector
    mulps  xmm0,  xmm0            ; mul with 2nd vector
    movaps xmm1,  xmm0            ; copy result
    shufps xmm1,  xmm1, 4Eh       ; shuffle: f1,f0,f3,f2
    addps  xmm0,  xmm1            ; add: f3+f1,f2+f0,f1+f3,f0+f2 
    movaps xmm1,  xmm0            ; copy results
    shufps xmm1,  xmm1, 11h       ; shuffle: f0+f2,f1+f3,f0+f2,f1+f3 
    addps  xmm0,  xmm1            ; add: x,x,f0+f1+f2+f3,f0+f1+f2+f3

    rsqrtps xmm0,  xmm0           ; recip. sqrt (faster than ss + shufps)
    mulps   xmm2,  xmm0           ; mul by reciprocal
    movups  [esi], xmm2           ; bring back result
}
w = 1.0f;

// with intrinsics instead:
w = 0.0f; // clear w so it doesn't effect calculation
__m128 vec = _mm_loadu_ps(&x); // load x,y,z,w into vec
__m128 vecOrig = vec; // save copy of original values
vec = _mm_mul_ps(vec,vec);
__m128 tmp = _mm_shuffle_ps(vec,vec,0x4E);
vec = _mm_add_ps(vec,tmp);
tmp = _mm_shuffle_ps(vec,vec,0x11);
vec = _mm_add_ps(vec,tmp);
vec = _mm_rsqrt_ps(vec); // calc reciprocal square root
vecOrig = _mm_mul_ps(vecOrig,vec); // multiply by inv square root
_mm_storeu_ps(&x,vecOrig); // store result back in *this
w = 1.0f; // restore w

        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <h3>08/29/2022</h3>
        <p>Have enough of the OpenGL render device, Vertex Cache, and Vertex Cache manager
        implemented to render a basic triangle. Learned you need to use
        glVertexAttribIPointer for integer attributes. Also learned the last
        argument to glDrawElements is used as a byte offset into the index
        buffer to use for drawing, assuming an index buffer is currently bound.</p>

        <h3>08/30/2022</h3>
        <p>Started the shaders for each vertex type in the vertex cache manager,
        vert cache manager render naked working.</p>

        <h3>08/31/2022</h3>
        <p>Render lines, points primitives working:</p>
        <img src="./images/drawprimitives_08_31_2022.png"/>

        <h3>09/03/2022</h3>
        <p>Added ZFXModel class for s3d models, and fixed the uu/VERTEX struct shader.
        The vector-matrix multiplication order needed to be switched because of the
        ZFXMatrix implementation:</p>
        <pre><code>//gl_Position = uWvpMatrix * vec4(aPos,1.0);
gl_Position = vec4(aPos,1.0) * uWvpMatrix;
        </code></pre>
        <p>Most of the chapter 6 demo now works; not implemented are multiple windows/viewports
        and font drawing, also lighting:</p>
        <img src="./images/chp06_demo_09_03_2022.png"/>

        <h3>09/14/2022</h3>
        <p>Initial Render Device CreateFont and DrawText working. Using fnt format font from
        <a href="https://angelcode.com/products/bmfont/">https://angelcode.com/products/bmfont/</a>,
        as the book implementation uses a built-in direct X library for loading Windows fonts.</p>
        <p>stb image was not properly loading the tga format generated for some reason, and I had
        to convert the image to a bmp instead:</p>

        <p>09/15/2022</p>
        <p>Started the chapter 7 demo (shaders). Just the basic unlit version for starters.
        Had to enable face culling and set the front face to clockwise instead of counter-clockwise:</p>
        <pre><code>glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);                                                                         
glFrontFace(GL_CW); 
        </code></pre>
        <img src="./images/chp07demo_started_09_15_2022.png"/>

        <p>09/18/2022</p>
        <p>Added two more chapter 7 demos - basic ambient lighting and multitexturing.</p>
        <img src="./images/chp07demo_basiclighting_09_18_2022.png"/><br/>
        <img src="./images/chp07demo_multitexturing_09_18_2022.png"/><br/>

        <p>06/29/2023</p>
        <p>Finished remaining chapter 7 demos - multiple point lights,
        grayscale filter, and bump mapping. For point lights, the book uses a multi-pass rendering technique
        to render 1 light at a time, starting with a base ambient lighting pass. I instead used a single
        shader with a hard-coded number of lights (2), and calculate point lighting using calculations from
        <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Multiple-lights">learnopengl</a>. For the grayscale
        filtering demo, my glsl shader calculation is mostly the same as in the book, except I used a different
        set of values following
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/Volcanoscar/4a9500d240497d3c0228f663593d167a">this github gist</a>.
        Finally, for the bump map demo, instead of transforming the light and other vectors into tangent
        space like in the book, I instead followed the
        <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Normal-Mapping">learnopengl</a> implementation and
        transformed the tangent vectors into world space within the vertex and fragment shader.
        To internally calculate the normal map texture from the input height texture, I used the already saved
        pixels in the current OpenGL texture class loaded by stbi, performed the processing on those, and saved
        the output file using stb_image_write to a png file:</p>

        <div>
            <img src="./images/textur_b.bmp"/>
            <img src="./images/ZFXNormalMap.png"/>
        </div>

        <p>The book calculates each normal via 3 pixels (current, right, below), however from reading online
        it's more common now to use a sobel filter on the current, top, bottom, left, and right pixels. The
        book's method seems to work fine at least for this demo.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
        <p>07/12/2023</p>

        <p>Chapter 8 mostly finished. I initially was trying use and follow the book's custom model format,
        but I was getting a parsing error with the included example model that I couldn't figure out, so
        I switched to IQM using code from my HopsLib. The parse error from the book's cbf format (Chunk
        Based Format) was related to the amount of bytes contained in the vertices portion of the file.
        I confirmed I was reading the same amount of bytes indicated by the chunk header, but there were still
        bytes remaining after that before the end-of-chunk indicator (0x9999), shown highlighted in the
        hex editor:</p>

        <div>
            <img src="./images/cbf_error_07_12_2023.png"/>
        </div>

        <p>Sense it was a custom format anyways, it didn't make sense to put alot of effort into it.
        Getting IQM models to work instead involved changing the HopsLib math objects with the ZFX versions
        and generating CVERTEX output vertices. By doing this I ran into a couple of bugs in the ZFXOpenGLVertexCache
        class related to skin/material selection and vertex buffer updating. I narrowed one down by
        using <a href="https://renderdoc.org/">RenderDoc</a> for the first time, which showed that the
        two IQM model vertex buffers from the test model contained identical vertices after the first frame,
        meaning the second buffer was being overwritten by the contents of the first buffer. This was because
        I was missing a call to glBindVertexArray prior to binding the buffer and updating the vertices.
        The second bug was that the second mesh's material wasn't being applied because its properties except
        the texture were identical, leading the code to believe a material change wasn't needed. The only thing left
        I think is a memory-out-of bounds error that seems to happen occasionally on Windows and every run on Linux.</p>

        <div>
            <img src="./images/iqmmodel_07_12_2023.png"/>
        </div>

        <p>08/01/2023</p>

        <p>I am dumb. The memory error was that I was freeing the buffer the IQM data is stored in before
        the object is destructed:</p>
        <pre>buf = new uchar[hdr.filesize];
if (fread(buf+sizeof(hdr), ...) ...
...
fclose(f);
delete[] buf;</pre>

        <p>I didn't notice it was freed initially because the buf pointer wasn't
        set to null after being freed, so I thought it was still valid...</p>
        <p>Now the IQM class just needs some cleanup, mostly related to time/frame
        tracking, which is hard-coded to update 1.0/60.0 seconds every frame
        regardless of the input time.</p>

        <p>08/18/2023</p>
        <p>Added support for glb meshes via Assimp. Was originally planning on adding b3d mesh support,
        as I found the mesh used in the book in this format
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071202174732/http://www.psionic3d.co.uk/gallery/displayimage.php?album=2&pos=4">here</a>.
        Assimp apparently supports this format, however the animation code I have using assimp errored out due to "nodes" not
        counting as "bones". Converted the also-included milkshape 3d format (ms3d) model to glb by downloading Blender 2.66
        from <a href="https://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.66/">here</a> (which included support for ms3d),
        exporting to dae, importing the dae to the default installed blender 3, and finally exporting to glb from there.</p>

        <img src="./images/blender2_zombie_ms3d.png" width="800px"/><br/>
        <img src="./images/zombie_blender3.png" width="800px"/>

        <p>The assimp animation code still has an issue with the resulting converted dae and fbx
        files, also due to nodes vs bones data structures, but this is good enough for now I think.
        It also has issues with some parts of the animation being jerky/some weird frames, I'm
        guessing due to how I'm estimating keyframes with interpolation</p>

        <img src="./images/zombieAnim08182023.png"/>

        <p>08/24/2023</p>

        <p>The zombie animation is fully working after converting it to IQM format.
        Finished chapter 9 - input system, using SDL2 and SDL2 joystick. Modified
        GetPosition() as the book only allowed for 1 object per joystick axis. I added an index
        argument as well to specify which analog stick/joystick to read. Also found out the joystick
        axes for an XBox 360 controller show up in the following order for SDL: 0 = left analog X axis,
        1 = left analog Y axis, 2 = Left Trigger, 3 = right analog X axis, 4 = right analog Y axis,
        5 = Right Trigger. The issue with this is GetPostion() takes in a ZFXPoint which reads both
        X and Y, and for the triggers there is only one axis. I re-ordered the read values so
        that the left and right trigger are paired as axes 4 and 5 instead of 2 and 5.</p>

        <p>The demo for this chapter is fairly simple, just displays text to the screen of input values:</p>

        <img src="./images/zfxInput08242023.png"/>

        <p>08/31/2023</p>

        <p>Partial completion of chapter 10 (audio) and I think full completion of chapter 11 networking.</p>

        <p>For audio, using SDL_Mixer, there is support to play a single sound/song at a time using "Mix_Music"
        objects. There is no 3D audio support currently. To support this, I would need to switch to use
        "Mix_Chunk" objects along with the "Mix_SetPosition" function, which takes in an angle and distance
        from the listener. Switching to chunks would also allow for multiple sounds to play at once.</p>

        <p>For networking, I learned about Win32 WSA sockets, through following the book's implementation.
        It is pretty similar to POSIX sockets, so alot of the code between the Windows and Linux versions
        matches. Most of the differences I used macros/defines to map to the correct platform:</p>

        <p>Additionally, unlike the book which used the Windows event system for async socket read/writes,
        I instead made a polling background thread that works for both implementations, which uses "select"
        to check if any events have occured on the socket:</p>

<pre><code>void ZFXNetworkDeviceImpl::EventPollThreadFcn()

        timeout.tv_usec = 50;

        if (m_Mode == NMD_SERVER) {

            // check for any connection requests
            FD_ZERO(&amp;set);
            FD_SET(m_pSockObj-&gt;GetSocket(), &amp;set);
            ret = select(m_pSockObj-&gt;GetSocket()+1, &amp;set, nullptr, nullptr, &amp;timeout);
            if (ZFX_SELECT_SUCCESS(ret)) {
                //printf("Poll thread calling OnAccept\n");
                OnAccept();
            }

            // check for any messages from clients
            for (int i = 0; i<m_ClCount; ++i) {
                if (m_Clients[i].skToClient == INVALID_SOCKET) {
                    continue;
                }
                FD_ZERO(&set);
                FD_SET(m_Clients[i].skToClient, &set);
                ret = select(m_Clients[i].skToClient+1, &set, nullptr, nullptr, &timeout);
                if (ZFX_SELECT_SUCCESS(ret)) {
                    //printf("Poll thread calling OnReceive\n");
                    OnReceive(m_Clients[i].skToClient);

        <p>For the demo application, I didn't make the full chat or file transfer applications
        as they used the Win32 API. Instead, I just made a simple test command line program where
        the server and client send each other a couple of messages with some test data:</p>

        <p>09/02/2023</p>

        <p>Finished chapter 12 - movement. For the demo application, the data included on the book CD seemed to be missing
        the movement code and was identical to the chapter 6 demo. I chose to add a ZFXMCEgo controller (which is what the
        book calls the class for FPS style input) and directly binded movement to SDL2. I could have used our previously made
        input class, but sense it's just a chapter demo I was lazy. One note is that the input class seems to only allow
        forward and backward movement, not left and right, which seems kind of strange.</p>
<pre><code>ZFXMCEgo* g_pMoveCtrl = nullptr;
...
// update time
Uint32 curTime = SDL_GetTicks();
Uint32 ticksPassed = curTime - lastTime;
float fElapsedTime = ((float)ticksPassed)/1000.0f;

// update input
g_pMoveCtrl-&gt;SetRotationSpeedX(0);
g_pMoveCtrl-&gt;SetRotationSpeedY(0);
SDL_Event e;
while (SDL_PollEvent(&amp;e))
{
    float fMoveSpd = 0.01f;
    float fRotSpd = 0.001f;
    if (e.type == SDL_QUIT) {
        g_bDone = true;
    } else if (e.type == SDL_KEYDOWN) {
        switch (e.key.keysym.sym) {

        default:
            break;

    } else if (e.type == SDL_KEYUP) {

        <p>Revisiting this project, doing a reorganization/rewrite. Planning
        to do different console implementations (ps3, vita, switch) as I go,
        which I think will be easier than trying to go back and port everything
        afterwords.</p>
        <p>Using gitlab for repo hosting as I've been trying it lately and
        testing it's CICD pipeline functionality. Also using CMake for build
        management (TODO - can I use CMake with the console ports?) and
        planning on putting all the code in a Zfx namespace, along with
        commenting thuroughly using Doxygen.</p>
        <p>The new repo is
        <a href="https://gitlab.com/beedge19/zfxengineopengl">
        https://gitlab.com/beedge19/zfxengineopengl
        </a>. If I finish I will probably put it on the github repo also,
        which I believe is private at the moment (TODO make public).</p>

        <p>Finished chapter 3 starting the Renderer and RenderDevice
        classes. PC and Switch both compiling the test application which
        clears the screen to green.</p>
        <p>I got the switch build using CMake via
        <a href="https://github.com/vbe0201/switch-cmake/tree/rewrite">
        https://github.com/vbe0201/switch-cmake/tree/rewrite
        </a> which provides CMake templates for devkitPro switch development.
        I made a small modification to FindLibnx.cmake to add portlibs to
        LIBNX_INCLUDE_DIRS for the EGL opengl impl. Then to compile for switch,
        in the command line you run:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir switchbuild && cd switchbuild
cmake .. -DZFX_SWITCH_BUILD=1 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../DevkitA64Libnx.cmake
VERBOSE=1 cmake --build .
</code></pre>
        <p>Which places libzfx.a and zfxTestRendererInit.nro in switchbuild/src.
        To run the program on the switch remotely with nxlink:</p>
<pre><code>nxlink --address <switch IP> -s ./src/zfxTestRendererInit.nro
</code></pre>

        <p>Also have initial Vita support implemented. Vitasdk includes a CMake
        configuration via /usr/local/vitasdk/share/vita.cmake and vita.toolchain.cmake.
        Similar to switch, the build process is:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir vitabuild && cd vitabuild
cmake .. -DZFX_VITA_BUILD=1 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/usr/local/vitasdk/share/vita.toolchain.cmake
VERBOSE=1 cmake --build .
</code></pre>

        <h3>01/06/2025 - 7:30pm - 9:30pm</h3>
        
        <p>Start initial PS3 impl. Found this github repo for ps3dev/psl1ght CMake toolchain configuration:
        <a href="https://github.com/zzanp/ps3-cmake/tree/master">https://github.com/zzanp/ps3-cmake/tree/master</a>.
        Have not tested yet. placed the scripts/binaries from this repo in $PS3DEV/bin so they can be ran from the
        command line anywhere. TODO after testing, place instructions for this in README. Started code on the initial
        PS3RenderDevice implementation, mostly copying code over from
        <a href="https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/hopslib/">https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/hopslib/</a>.</p>

        <h3>01/07/2025 - 7:00pm - 9:30pm</h3>

        <p>Finish initial PS3 impl. The ps3dev cmake toolchain from github worked smoothly, however it didn't
        contain a command for .self generation, so I added a macro in my top level CMakeLists.txt to do this:</p>
<pre><code>macro(ps3_create_self elfTarget)
    add_custom_command(OUTPUT ${elfTarget}.self
        COMMAND ppu-strip ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${elfTarget} -o ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${elfTarget} &&
            sprxlinker ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${elfTarget} &&
            make_self ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${elfTarget} ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${elfTarget}.self &&
            fself ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${elfTarget} ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${elfTarget}.fake.self
        DEPENDS ${elfTarget}
        VERBATIM)
    add_custom_target(${elfTarget}Self ALL DEPENDS ${elfTarget}.self)
endmacro()
</code></pre>

        <p>Also, for the clear/background color, I didn't remember the format of the bytes for the argument
        to rsxSetClearColor. After some experimentation, the order turned out to be ARGB:</p>
<pre><code>const u32 color =
    0xFF000000 | // alpha
    (u32(mClearColor[0]*255.0f)<<16) | // red
    (u32(mClearColor[1]*255.0f)<<8) | // green
    (u32(mClearColor[2]*255.0f)); // blue
rsxSetClearColor(mGcmCtx, color);
</code></pre>

        <p>Finally, the cmake build process is:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ps3build && cd ps3build
ppu-cmake .. -DZFX_PS3_BUILD=1
cmake --build .
</code></pre>

        <p>I also added a define check around the contents of the header/source files for the OpenGL/PS3
        implementations so their contents are only processed on the correct platforms,
        without needing to conditionally include/exclude files in the CMake configuration.</p>

        <p>I tested the PS3 build on both hardware and in rpcs3:</p>
