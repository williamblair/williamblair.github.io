        <h3>Sample Rate/USB</h3>
         USB 2.0 is a 480 Mbit/s half-duplex serial protocol.

        <p>
            Assuming 100% utilization, 480 Mbits/s would be 60 Mbytes/second.
            According to a USB-IF chairman, “at least 10-15% of the stated peak 60 MB/s (480 Mbit/s) of Hi-Speed USB goes to overhead — the communication protocol between the card and the peripheral.” 2), that would bring things down to ~50 Mbytes/second.
            There are Control Transfers, Interrupt Transfers, Isochronous Transfers, and Bulk Transfers. We use bulk, but you can't turn off the others, so you loose another 10% overhead, this brings things down to ~45 Mbytes/second
            Since it is half duplex, that would be ~22.5 Mbytes/second for transmission, and ~22.5 Mbytes/second for reception.
            Since each sample is two bytes (12-bit samples), that would be ~11 MSamples/second.
        </p>

        <h3>Frequency Range</h3>
        The tuning range of the AD9363 found inside the PlutoSDR is specified by LO center frequencies between 325 and 3800 MHz

        <h3>Loopback Warning:</h3>
        Do not set the TX attenuation to anything less than -10dB and loop the Tx (output) signal into the Rx (input) connector

        <h3>USB Console Access</h3>
        Shows up on COM port 3 (PlutoSDR Serial Console)

        Serial

        <p>
        You need to have find your favorite Terminal program, here are a few of the ones we use (but don't support - if you have questions, please check with the internet/google).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Putty</li>
            <li>Tera Term</li>
            <li>Or other Terminal program</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        The terminal settings are 115200 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. This is referred to as 115200-8N1. The default username is root, and the default root password is analog. 
        </p>

        <p>
        On windows, followed this guide:

        <figcaption>installed 'screen' in cygwin:
        <img src="./images/cygwin_screen_setup.png"/>
        </figure>

        <p>
        run the command 'screen.exe /dev/ttyS2 115200'
        <img src="./images/cygwin_screen_pluto_running.png"/>
        To quit screen, enter 'Ctrl+a d' (after logging out)
        I noticed it seems like you always have to kill the process though after this
        </p>

        <p>
        You can also log in via ssh over usb:
        ssh root@192.168.2.1
        </p>
        <p>
        (an ifconfig shows that the usb0 interface has this IP addr)
        </p>

        <h3>Installing libIIO</h3>
        <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio">https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio</a>
        Or direct link specifically this EXE for windows:
        <a href="https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio/releases/download/v0.21/libiio-0.21.g565bf68-Windows-setup.exe">https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio/releases/download/v0.21/libiio-0.21.g565bf68-Windows-setup.exe</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Pluto USB drive</h3>
        <p>Pluto shows up as an external drive in windows (E: for me) which
        contains an info.html page with most of this info contained as well
        as other links</p>
