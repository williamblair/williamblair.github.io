    sub $t1, $t1, 1
    b start_loop # goto start_loop (continue the while loop)
end_loop:
    ...
</code></pre>

<h3>Instruction Addresses</h3>
<p>A label is a marker of a memory address within the binary code. The
first program instruction is inserted at address 0x00400000</p>
<img src="instruction_address.png"/>

<p>The program counter (pc) points to the NEXT instruction to execute,
so branching accounts for this difference (4 bytes). Since each instruction
is 4byte aligned, the first 2 bits of each instruction addr are always 00,
so in the branch instruction these bits are not included and are implied, 
allowing for a wider range of possible branch locations (2<sup>18</sup> to
be exact).</p>

<h3>PC relative addressing</h3>
<p>Branch instructions use an offset from the current PC, while jump 
instructions use absolute addresses. The Jump instruction (j) can access
the entire .text segment (26 bits of address data). Branch instructions
can to comparisons but are limited to 16 bits of address data.</p>

<h3>Using branches vs jumps</h3>
<p>Basically, use branching when code is inside the same file (if/loop statements); 
use jumping when the code is in a different file (subprograms)</p>
