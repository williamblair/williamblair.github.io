<h1>GameLib Log: 2023</h1>

<h3>01/02/2023</h3>
<p>Testing different 3d model formats for the AssimpMesh class. I tried 3DS
but it seems this format doesn't store skeletal information, or at least
assimp doesn't load it. Also it seems Blender doesn't support 3DS by default.
So far, glTF and DAE have been tested working on PC, and glTF on PS3. IQM
format loads but doesn't have animations/skeleton.</p>

<h3>01/04/2023</h3>
<p>Starting to add physics, currently reading &amp; following
<a href="https://gamephysicscookbook.com/">"Game Physics Cookbok" by Gabor Szauer</a>.
Today finished adding chapters 4 and 5, which adds some 2D shapes and collision
detection: Rectangles, oriented rectangles, circles, lines, and points.</p>

<h3>01/05/2023</h3>
<p>Started chapter 6 of game physics cookbook; Added 2d ContainingRect/Circle and QuadTree.</p>

<h3>01/13/2023</h3>
<p>Finished chapter 6 &amp; 7 of game physics cookbook. Added 3d primitives Point3, Sphere,
AABB, OBB, Ray, Plane, Line3.</p>

<h3>01/20/2023</h3>
<p>Started chapter 8 code of game physics. Starts 3d point intersections and point
on surface nearest to other points.</p>

<h3>01/21/2023</h3>
<p>Finished game physics chapter 8 and started chapter 9; added Sphere collision
detections.</p>

<h3>01/22/2023</h3>
<p>Finished game physics chapter 9; AABB, OBB, Plane collision detections.</p>

<h3>01/23/2023</h3>
<p>Started game physics chapter 10; ray and Sphere, ABB, OBB collisions.</p>

<h3>01/31/2023</h3>
<p>Finished game physics chapter 10; Line and sphere, ABB, OBB collisions.</p>

<h3>02/04/2023</h3>
<p>Started game physics chapter 11; triangle tests</p>

<h3>02/05/2023</h3>
<p>Finished game physics chapter 11 (skipped model struct); started test physics example</p>

<h3>02/05/2023</h3>
<p>Added floor and camera to test physics example; TODO start defining physics objects and testing</p>

<h3>02/08/2023</h3>
<p>Added sphere, plane, and line to physics objects in demo; collision seems working so far. Added DrawLine to PC renderer.</p>

<h3>02/09/2023</h3>
<p>Added AABB, OBB and another sphere to collision tests; added draw aabb/obb to PC renderer. Looks like so far:</p>

</video>

<h3>02/11/2023</h3>
<p>Finished physics chapter 12; starting HopsPhysics namespace - named "World" and "Body" instead of "Scene" and "Model".</p>

<h3>02/16/2023</h3>
<p>Started physics chapter 13; Frustum class; Point, AABB, OBB and Frustum collision.</p>

<h3>02/18/2023</h3>
<p>Continue physics chapter 13; Add raycasting and unproject screen to world coordinates. Testing raycasting video:</p>

    <source src="./images/raycast_02_18_2023.webm" type="video/webm"/>
</video>

<h3>02/20/2023</h3>
<p>Continue physics chapter 13. Frustum from view,projection matrices and sphere-frustum collision detection working.
Referenced "Fast Extraction of Viewing Frustum Planes from the World-View-Projection Matrix" by Gribb and Hartmann:
<a href="http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/postgrads/alexis/planeExtraction.pdf">http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/postgrads/alexis/planeExtraction.pdf</a>.
The book code didn't work with my current code, presumably due to handed-ness and matrix orientation. Testing video below; the floor
becomes dark if the sphere is outside of the view frustum, and light if the sphere is inside of the view frustum:</p>

<h3>02/23/2023</h3>
<p>Started physics chapter 14; updated Raycast functions to use RaycastResult struct with normal, time, and location.</p>

<h3>02/24/2023</h3>
<p>Finished physics chapter 14; PhysicsSystem, RigidBody, Particle classes.</p>

<h3>02/25/2023</h3>
<p>Finished chapter 14 demo. Particle simulation seems to be working. TODO - be able to draw AABBs and OBBs as solid instead of
see through; it's a little difficult to make out here:</p>

<h3>02/26/2023</h3>
<p>Started physics chapter 15: manifolds and rigid bodies with volume. Added collision manifolds for OBB and sphere and started
RigidBodyVolume class.</p>

<h3>02/28/2023</h3>
<p>Continue physics chapter 15. Started collision resolution and rotational impulses.</p>

<h3>03/27/2023</h3>
<p>Have been working through "Game Phyisics Engine Development" by Ian Millington.
Have implemented up to the Bridge demo, then paused to re-organize the repository
to consolidate same/similar code.</p>

<p>Next, got assimp library compiled for PSP and Wii, and tested a gltf model:</p>
<video controls width="600px">
    <source src="./images/psp_assimp_03_27_2023.webm" type="video/webm"/>
</video>

<p>For the PSP I had to disable/comment out the internal assimp logging,
and for the Wii I basically had to make the same big endian changes I did for the PS3.
The modified assimp repositories are: <a href="https://github.com/williamblair/assimp-wii">https://github.com/williamblair/assimp-wii</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/williamblair/assimp-psp">https://github.com/williamblair/assimp-psp</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, fixed lighting on the Wii to work properly with the textured assimp model.
Mainly needed to change the GX_SetTevOp argument to GX_MODULATE for textured vertex buffers.</p>
