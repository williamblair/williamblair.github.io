<h1>GameLib Log: 2023</h1>

<h3>01/02/2023</h3>
<p>Testing different 3d model formats for the AssimpMesh class. I tried 3DS
but it seems this format doesn't store skeletal information, or at least
assimp doesn't load it. Also it seems Blender doesn't support 3DS by default.
So far, glTF and DAE have been tested working on PC, and glTF on PS3. IQM
format loads but doesn't have animations/skeleton.</p>

<h3>01/04/2023</h3>
<p>Starting to add physics, currently reading &amp; following
<a href="https://gamephysicscookbook.com/">"Game Physics Cookbok" by Gabor Szauer</a>.
Today finished adding chapters 4 and 5, which adds some 2D shapes and collision
detection: Rectangles, oriented rectangles, circles, lines, and points.</p>

<h3>01/05/2023</h3>
<p>Started chapter 6 of game physics cookbook; Added 2d ContainingRect/Circle and QuadTree.</p>

<h3>01/13/2023</h3>
<p>Finished chapter 6 &amp; 7 of game physics cookbook. Added 3d primitives Point3, Sphere,
AABB, OBB, Ray, Plane, Line3.</p>

<h3>01/20/2023</h3>
<p>Started chapter 8 code of game physics. Starts 3d point intersections and point
on surface nearest to other points.</p>

<h3>01/21/2023</h3>
<p>Finished game physics chapter 8 and started chapter 9; added Sphere collision
detections.</p>

<h3>01/22/2023</h3>
<p>Finished game physics chapter 9; AABB, OBB, Plane collision detections.</p>

<h3>01/23/2023</h3>
<p>Started game physics chapter 10; ray and Sphere, ABB, OBB collisions.</p>

<h3>01/31/2023</h3>
<p>Finished game physics chapter 10; Line and sphere, ABB, OBB collisions.</p>

<h3>02/04/2023</h3>
<p>Started game physics chapter 11; triangle tests</p>

<h3>02/05/2023</h3>
<p>Finished game physics chapter 11 (skipped model struct); started test physics example</p>

<h3>02/05/2023</h3>
<p>Added floor and camera to test physics example; TODO start defining physics objects and testing</p>

<h3>02/08/2023</h3>
<p>Added sphere, plane, and line to physics objects in demo; collision seems working so far. Added DrawLine to PC renderer.</p>

<h3>02/09/2023</h3>
<p>Added AABB, OBB and another sphere to collision tests; added draw aabb/obb to PC renderer. Looks like so far:</p>

<h3>02/11/2023</h3>
<p>Finished physics chapter 12; starting HopsPhysics namespace - named "World" and "Body" instead of "Scene" and "Model".</p>
