<h1>GameLib Log: 2024</h1>

<h3>05/25/2024</h3>
<p>I've been working on a major re-write of the library. For this newer
version I've currently dropped support for PSP and Wii, as I wanted to
work with systems that support shaders. Now, the current supported platforms
are PC, PS3, PS Vita, and Switch. I'd also like to add support for the
original XBox as that supports shaders also.</p>

<p>The previous version I've added a git tag for as
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/hopslib/src/v0.1/">v0.1</a>.</p>

<p>The following improvements have been added compared to the previous version
so far:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Simplified directories/source code - more common/shared code between platforms</li>
    <li>Scene Graph - transform hierarchy and view frustum culling</li>
    <li>Game parent class for easier/more organized application setup</li>
    <li>Shadows (in progress, but kind-of working)</li>
</ul>

<p>Missing features from v0.1:</p>
<ul>
    <p>Static &amp; animated models/file formats</p>
    <p>Bounding volume debug drawing</p>
    <p>Physics</p>
    <p>Music/Audio</p>
    <p>Threads</p>
</ul>

<p>Below shows the current shadow and scene graph/hierarchy in action:
the ground is the root node, then sphere then cube as children, each transform
affecting its children:</p>

<h3>05/27/2024</h3>

<p>Working on simplifying/unifying shaders between platforms. PC and Switch
use GLSL while Vita and PS3 use Cg. Although the VitaGL github says there is
experimental GLSL support, TODO look into that.</p>

<p>I'm not really too familiar with Cg so I spent some time looking at the
following links:

<a href="https://developer.download.nvidia.com/cg/Cg_3.1/Cg-3.1_April2012_ReferenceManual.pdf">
https://developer.download.nvidia.com/cg/Cg_3.1/Cg-3.1_April2012_ReferenceManual.pdf
</a>,

<a href="https://developer.download.nvidia.com/CgTutorial/cg_tutorial_chapter01.html">
https://developer.download.nvidia.com/CgTutorial/cg_tutorial_chapter01.html</a>

</p>

<p>While attempting to implement the shadow mapping shader for Vita, I found
that glGetShaderInfoLog wasn't returning anything.
Re-installed VitaGL from source, enabling error logging via
"make HAVE_SHARK_LOG=1 LOG_ERRORS=2." and then I could see why the shader
compilations were failing.</p>

<p>Vita doesn't have inverse function in shader, so defined one for float3x3 
using the same logic from the HopsLib math source code.</p>

<p>VitaGL also doesn't support using a depth attachment to a framebuffer,
so I attempted to calculate it and store it in the color attachment, using
the following reference for calculation:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10264949/glsl-gl-fragcoord-z-calculation-and-setting-gl-fragdepth</a>,

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6408851/draw-the-depth-value-in-opengl-using-shaders#6409229</a>
</p>

<p>It kind-of works, but the objects themselves have some incorrect shading/
artifacts. Good enough for now though:</p>

</video>

<p>Am currently attempting to update and run the PS3 version. The same Cg
shaders are compiling for ps3 as for Vita, but I think there are some code
fixes needed for creation/usage of a framebuffer for rsx. The skybox is
drawing and the game isn't crashing (at least in rpcs3), but the scene itself
is not rendering.</p>

<h3>05/28/2024</h3>

<p>Updating the ps3 version - the cg shaders from the vita are compiling.
While making a basic unlit shader for debugging, had to send the vertex normals
to the fragment shader even though they were unused so that the cg compiler
didn't optimize them away; this was causing the normals to be used as the color
in the fragment shader.</p>
<p>Now that that's working, next is to get the framebuffer ps3 impl working.</p>

<h3>06/01/2024</h3>

<p>PS3 current shadow map impl working. I debugged the the shadow depth map
generation by displaying the texture onscreen as a sprite. I noticed the PS3
version was flipped vertically compared to the PC and Vita versions. My
workaround for this so far is to add a define during PS3 shader calculation
to flip the uv y coordinate in the cg fragment shader. In Makefile.ps3, I
added:</p>

<pre><code># Cg compiler flags
CGCFLAGS	:= -Wcg,-DHOPS_PS3_BUILD=1
</code></pre>

<p>Then in ShadowedFragment.fcg:</p>

<pre><code>float2 uv = clamp(projCoords.xy,0,1);

    // set in Makefile.ps3
#ifdef HOPS_PS3_BUILD
    uv.y = 1.0 - uv.y;
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>I also needed to normalize the color attribute and the light space fragment
position, and clamp the shadow map uv between 0 and 1; and to change
the clear color for the color buffers to 1/white instead of 0/black in order to
match the original PC depth buffer texture. These changes also had the benefit
of getting rid of the artifacts the Vita version previously had.</p>

<h3>06/30/2024</h3>
<p>Fixed shutdown crash on Vita, kind-of fixed on ps3. Ps3 hangs then beeps three times but
exits to the home screen as opposed to totally freezing like before. On vita I was re-freeing
the texture for the framebuffer as it was already freed by the framebuffer class. On Ps3
the shader class was freeing the embedded skybox and 2d sprite shaders, and also wasn't
handling when the home button/exit is pressed. Also, I was calling free() instead of rsxFree() on
the ps3 vertex buffer memory. Not sure why the ps3 is hanging/beeping on exit currently. Might
have to do something with in the sample code, gcmSetWaitFlip()/rsxFinish() are the very last
function calls done in the system exit callback, as opposed to the Renderer destructor.</p>

<h3>07/08/2024</h3>
<p>Integrated Imgui, at least visually so far. Interaction (being able to close/move/select dropdowns) is next.
PC/Vita/Switch were fairly straightforward, I was able to follow the OpenGL3 implementation from
<a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/backends/imgui_impl_opengl3.cpp">
https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/backends/imgui_impl_opengl3.cpp</a>.
</p>
<p>On PS3 I ran into more issues. First, as ps3 is big endian, the ImGUI RGBA generated texture was
actually ABGR because each pixel is packed into a 32bit integer, hence the bytes were backwards.
Additionally, the texture format uploaded to gpu memory is in ARGB format (as opposed to RGBA) which
caused the bytes to be even more scrambled. The vertices color attribute given by ImGUI is also
a 32 bit integer, which again was flipped bytewise. For the OpenGL implementations you can normalize
the attribute to a vec4 float, but that wasn't available in the ps3 rsx library. I tried doing
the conversion in the vertex shader but they don't support bit shifting and masking. I instead
tried just doing divisions and subtractions to extract each color component, but I couldn't get
that working either. I finally ended up doing the conversion in the Vertex buffer init/update
functions, converting to a custom vertex structure instead which has a vec4 for the color instead of the
32bit int. This also does the byte swapping so the RGBA values are in the correct order. Whew!
The results (initial errors + working version) are shown below:</p>

<p>Basic imgui input on PC working; TODO gamepad/joystick support. Also missing mouse scrollwheel
input atm. Implementation is fairly straightforward. There is a ImGui_ImplHops_ProcessEvent() function
that maps Hops input keys/mouse to ImGui keys which you forward to the ImGui io object.</p>

<h3>07/10/2024</h3>
<p>Controller/joystick input for imgui working. Tested on PS3, initially found rendering issue
when using multiple windows:</p>
<video controls width="800px">
    <source src="./images/imgui_ps3_render_issue_07_10_2024.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
<p>I'm guessing the issue was that we were overwriting the vertices in the rsx memory while
the old ones were still being rendered. Switching to using one vertex buffer per imgui draw
list fixed the issue.</p>
<p>Currently now am having a rendering issue on switch where the imgui components are
rendering fine but the background 3d scene right now is not rendering at all, just the
screen background clear color.</p>

<h3>07/13/2024</h3>
<p>Fixed switch issue. Turned out not to be a rendering problem, it was actually
that the joystick analog values were not being initialized, sometimes resulting in
garbage values that were being read as camera movement input and causing the
scene to go haywire. That's what I get for not initializing all my variables
properly, like in the constructor. I also never added the update on switch
to accept analog input, so I added that too:</p>
<pre><code>// new; were missing before
mLeftJoyX = mLeftJoyY = 0.0f;
mRightJoyX = mRightJoyY = 0.0f;
...
const HidAnalogStickState& stickL = gPad.sticks[0];
const HidAnalogStickState& stickR = gPad.sticks[1];
// scale from -32768,32768 to -1,1
mLeftJoyX = float(stickL.x)/32768.0f;
mLeftJoyY = -float(stickL.y)/32768.0f;
mRightJoyX = float(stickR.x)/32768.0f;
mRightJoyY = -float(stickR.y)/32768.0f;
</code></pre>
