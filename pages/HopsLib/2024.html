<h1>GameLib Log: 2024</h1>

<h3>05/25/2024</h3>
<p>I've been working on a major re-write of the library. For this newer
version I've currently dropped support for PSP and Wii, as I wanted to
work with systems that support shaders. Now, the current supported platforms
are PC, PS3, PS Vita, and Switch. I'd also like to add support for the
original XBox as that supports shaders also.</p>

<p>The previous version I've added a git tag for as
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/williamblair/hopslib/src/v0.1/">v0.1</a>.</p>

<p>The following improvements have been added compared to the previous version
so far:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Simplified directories/source code - more common/shared code between platforms</li>
    <li>Scene Graph - transform hierarchy and view frustum culling</li>
    <li>Game parent class for easier/more organized application setup</li>
    <li>Shadows (in progress, but kind-of working)</li>
</ul>

<p>Missing features from v0.1:</p>
<ul>
    <p>Static &amp; animated models/file formats</p>
    <p>Bounding volume debug drawing</p>
    <p>Physics</p>
    <p>Music/Audio</p>
    <p>Threads</p>
</ul>

<p>Below shows the current shadow and scene graph/hierarchy in action:
the ground is the root node, then sphere then cube as children, each transform
affecting its children:</p>
