<h1 class="title">PS3 CFW Installation, ps3load, and ps3sdk install</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">To build run homebrew on PS3</h2>
<h3>05/14/2021</h3>

<p>I decided to get a "new" PS3 today because my old one that I had installed
CFW on previously bit the bullet. Figured I'd document the process this time.
I should do the same thing for PS2 FreeMCBoot and PS2 Linux install too at some
point...</p>

<p>Mostly followed steps from this video here:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eckd06nFReY">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eckd06nFReY</a>, except I used a different
CFW download because the PS3 I got was on OFW version 4.87 not 4.86:
<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/">
https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/</a>, which
as of today based on the playstation.com link is the latest version.</p>

<p>First, open the PS3 web browser, and clear all cache/history/browsing datae/etc.
Make sure javascript and flash are enabled. Then navigate the PS3 web browser to
https://www.ps3xploit.net, which should redirect you to
https://www.ps3xploit.net/bgtoolset (The webpage showed up as blank for me if I
tried directly going to /bgtoolset). It will confirm your PS3 model is capable
of being jailbroken with a little green checkmark:
</p>
<img src="images/20210514_190916.jpg" width="500px"/>
<p>The ps3 I got was a fat CECHP01 model, based on the back serial
number</p>
<img src="images/20210514_185509.jpg" width="500px"/>

<p>Next, click on "Flash Memory" with a fat32 formatted flash drive plugged
into the PS3 to make a backup of the current firmware or something like that</p>
<img src="images/20210514_191005.jpg" width="500px"/>
<img src="images/20210514_191009.jpg" width="500px"/>

<p>Then, click on "Flash Memory Patch" then "Load Patch via HTTPS" to download the
initial flash to allow CFW installation</p>
<img src="images/20210514_191205.jpg" width="500px"/>
<img src="images/20210514_191225.jpg" width="500px"/>

<p>I had to restart the PS3 and re-clear all browsing data the first time after I
had closed the ps3browser/tried to run the "load patch via HTTPS twice", where
it was stuck trying to connect to download the image.</p>

<p>Once finished, click on "Flash Memory Patch" again then "Apply Loaded Patch"
to actually flash the image</p>
<img src="images/20210514_194742.jpg" width="500px"/>
<img src="images/20210514_194941.jpg" width="500px"/>
<img src="images/20210514_194944.jpg" width="500px"/>

<p>Once that's done, shut down the PS3 and put the CFW image on fat32 flash drive
under PS3/UPDATE from the root directory. The CFW Image I got from following
the links here:
<a href="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/4-87-ofw-released-cfw-homebrew-exploits-updates-for-4-87.31957/">
https://www.psx-place.com/threads/4-87-ofw-released-cfw-homebrew-exploits-updates-for-4-87.31957/</a>
then <a href="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/cfw-4-87-2-evilnat-cobra-cex.32057/">
https://www.psx-place.com/threads/cfw-4-87-2-evilnat-cobra-cex.32057/</a> where I selected
the CFW EVILNAT 4.87.2 COBRA [CEX] version. I noted the last page listed my PS3 model,
CECHP01, as a tested version for this firmware.</p>
<p>The resulting file on my flash drive was PS3/UPDATE/PS3UPDAT.PUP</p>

<p>After rebooting the PS3 with the flash drive plugged in, then going to system update-&gt;
update via storage media, should get a screen saying it found the update file</p>
<img src="images/20210514_195140.jpg" width="500px"/>

<p>Selecting that and clicking auto reboot, should get a system updating screen, then
it will go through the update process.</p>

<p>Once that's done, you can download and put multiman and ps3load software
for the ps3 on the root of the fat32 usb device, downloaded from here:
<a href="https://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=42">
https://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=42</a>
and here:
<a href="https://store.brewology.com/multiman.php">https://store.brewology.com/multiman.php</a>
. Multiman is what lets you run ps3 games, ps2 games, emulators, etc. From the PS3 internal
harddrive, and ps3load lets you send and run PS3 homebrew over a TCP connection from your PC
to the ps3.</p>
<p>To install these from the usb device on the ps3, navigate to game, package manager,
install package files, standard, and then you should see ps3load and multiman to select
and install.</p>

<p>Once installed, reboot the ps3 and you should see ps3load as an app to run under
the network section. Once running it should show a screen that shows IP info
which will be important later to run ps3 software remotely</p>

<img src="images/20210514_202349.jpg" width="500px"/>

<p>Now to install the ps3sdk. This part was easy but takes a minute depending
on how fast your computer is</p>
<p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir /usr/local/ps3dev
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/ps3dev
sudo chgrp -R $USER /usr/local/ps3dev
echo 'export PS3DEV=/usr/local/ps3dev' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PSL1GHT=$PS3DEV' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/bin' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/ppu/bin' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/spu/bin' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
&lt;close/reopen new terminal&gt;
git clone https://github.com/ps3dev/ps3toolchain.git
cd ps3toolchain
sudo  apt-get install autoconf automake bison flex gcc libelf-dev make \
    texinfo libncurses5-dev patch python subversion wget zlib1g-dev \
    libtool libtool-bin python-dev bzip2 libgmp3-dev pkg-config g++ libssl-dev clang
./toolchain.sh
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>I'm not sure about Windows support for the ps3sdk, but note that there is
a toolchain-mingw.sh script in the ps3toolchain folder, so maybe it can be installed
via msys and mingw on windows? TODO - try this.</p>

<p>Then, to try and build and run a sample with ps3load that we installed earlier
on the ps3, cd into ps3toolchain/build/psl1ght/samples and run 'make'.
For me some of the samples failed to compile, but most of the ones in graphics
seemed to work. cd into graphics/rsxtest and there should be a file
rsxtest.self, which is the binary to test run on the ps3.</p>
<p>To use ps3load to run it, add the environment variable PS3LOAD=tcp:&lt;PS3 IP address&gt;
(for example PS3LOAD=tcp:192.168.0.2)
and run</p>
<pre><code>ps3load ./rsxtest.self
</code></pre>
<p>Which should output something like</p>
<pre><code>ps3load v0.5
coded by dhewg, #wiidev efnet

compressing 160704 bytes... 98.84%
connecting to 192.168.0.14:4299
sending upload request
sending file size (158844 bytes)
sending data..
sending arguments (14 bytes)
done.
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming ps3load is already running on the PS3. The ps3 should then boot the executable
and we can see some cool graphics!</p>
