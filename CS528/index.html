Downloaded base kernel from 
<a href="git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git">
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
</a>, following chapter 2 of the the textbook
</p>

Downloaded ubuntu base kernel using 
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile">this</a>
guide - was getting build errors from yesterdays source and this
seemed easier. Build is taking forever! paused it partway through 
(saved virtual machine state)
</p>

Build finished - had to install libssl-dev, other than that the above
guide seemed to work fine. Trying Torvald's base kernel again
to see if build issues were just dependencies... and it worked!
The build was much faster this time than the ubuntu kernel.
Kernel build was 4.19-rc1, installed with 
<pre><code>make defconfig 
make -j2
make -j2 modules 
make modules install 
make install 
update-grub </code></pre>
(as root). To verify I was booting the new kernel, I went into
'Advance options for Ubuntu' in the grub menu.
