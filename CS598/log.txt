12/18/18
--------
- implemented SDL_FillRect
- implemented SDL_MapRGB
- Implemented SDL_PollEvent
- Implemented Initial Joystick functionality (directional hats)
- Switched compilation to make libSDL.a instead of source as part of project

12/19/18
--------
- Added diagonals to directional buttons
- Added square/cross/triangle/circle
- Added a debug print to the screen (in addition to tty)
- Added select/start/R1/R2/L1/L2

12/23/18
--------
- Added joysticks
- Changed mapping of buttons/joysticks to match XBox 360 controller mappings on PC

12/26/18
--------
- Started working towards SDL_LoadBMP
    i. Basic File I/O (SDL_rwops) working
   ii. SDL_AllocFormat
- Started implementing SDL_CalculateBlit

12/31/18
--------
- Finished SDL_CalculateBlit
- SDL_BlitSurface now basically implemented, but either isn't working
  or my SDL_CreateRGB surface test isn't done properly 

01/04/19
--------
-Fixed SDL_BlitSurface
  i. Turns out the issue was my texture size for the PSX was too large (256px instead of 255)
-SDL_LoadBMP now fully implemented!

01/29/19
--------
-Optimized SDL_BlitSurface
  i. Surface data is now stored in PSX Vram, so we can draw them as PSX sprites for hardware acceleration
  ii. If the surface being blitted to is the surface created by SDL_SetVideoMode() (the background),
      we draw it as a sprite instead of actually 'blitting' (copying pixels) for a huge performance boost!

02/01/19
--------
-Optimized SDL_FillRect
  i. Instead of creating an SDL surface/filling it to the background, we draw a PSX GPU Rectangle primitive
     (again, for hardware acceleration!)

02/04/19
--------
-Working on fixing SDL_LoadBMP
  i. It turns out the colors are backwards since the PSX stores pixels in BGR format, so we need to switch
     the R and B components of each pixel on load
-Removed the two-times scale from all drawing that we were previously using before, as we have
 hardware acceleration now and don't need to worry about size for performance any more
-Added automatic texture upload location to vram (for storing multiple surfaces/sprites)
  i. TODO - what if we want to delete/remove an image or need to make room for new sprites?

02/05/19
--------
-Added uv texture offset (texture clipping) support, so you can select an area from INSIDE the texture
 to use to draw (useful for sprite animations)

02/08/19
--------
-Lots of code cleanup

02/12/19
--------
-Started setup for SDL_mixer (music library)

02/13/19
--------
-Added Mix_OpenAudio()
-Added Mix_GetError() (TODO - add SDL_GetError())
-Added wav2vag function for converting .WAV input files to .RAW (copied/modified from psxsdk wav2vag source)

02/15/19
--------
-Added Mix_LoadMUS()
  i. Limitations - file must be in .RAW format, must be single channel, and if converted from a WAV
     file, must have a frequency of 11025 Hz
  i. the second argument, 'loops' doesnt do anything
-Added Mix_PlayMusic()

02/16/19
--------
-Added SDL_Delay and SDL_SetColorKey as dummy functions
  i. e.g. they do nothing; they are defined as ';' in the header
  ii. This is because the PSX already runs at 60Hz approximately,
      and automatically treats black (0,0,0) as transparent

02/17/19
--------
-Added SDL_JoystickUpdate(), SDL_JoystickGetAxis(), SDL_JoystickGetHat()
  i. This allows for easier programming when checking button/directional
     presses as you don't have to run them within an SDL_PollEvent loop,
     and can just directly check if a button is pressed or not instead
     of checking for an UP or DOWN event in the event loop

02/22/19
--------
- Added SDL_Quit(), Mix_CloseAudio(), SDL_WM_ToggleFullScreen() as dummy functions
- Fixed VRAM loading
  i. I was incorrectly calculating new texture x locations aligned to widths of 64 (the width of a texture page)

02/24/19
--------
- Added 8bit bmp image support
  i. Re added the SDL code to load bmp images
  ii. 8bit image palettes are stored underneath the two display buffers
  iii. added logic to align images width to match 2 bytes
       display correctly/load correctly in PSX vram (since vram is 16bit --> buffers loaded must be 2 byte aligned)

02/26/19
--------
- Added 640x480 resolution support
  i. However, when running actual 640x480 code on the psx i appear to get screen tearing/flickering

03/07/19
--------
Added project paper repository, initial layout

03/08/19
--------
- Added Mix_FreeMusic() and Mix_FreeChunk() dummy functions

03/10/19
--------
- Added images for GPU and system hardware to writeup

03/11/19
--------
- Added GTE information to writeup and references

03/13/19
--------
- Added list of SDL ports to related work in writeup

03/14/19
--------
- Added SDL information to writeup

03/16/19
--------
- Added Order Table information to writeup

03/18/19
--------
- Added psxsdk installation instructions to writeup

03/20/19
--------
- Added implementation chapter base, description of psxsdk hello world program and screenshot to writeup
- Worked on test/example program to test SDL implementation
